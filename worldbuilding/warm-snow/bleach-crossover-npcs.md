# Bleach crossover: NPCs, shops, and upgrades
How Warm Snow’s upgrade/services loop ports into Soul Society and Hell operations.

## Core service NPCs (crossover spins)
- **Blacksmith / Forge-master**: Runs rarity upgrades and mimic stamping. In Seireitei guise, poses as a maintenance officer who “tunes” confiscated weapons; in Hell, smelts soulsteel with Chains Path escorts. Can secretly re-roll mimic stat lines mid-raid (limited charges).
- **Relic Vendor / Apothecary**: Sells relics/elixirs in neutral zones (Rukongai markets, Dangai rest pockets). Knows how to mask relic signatures so they read as harmless charms to Kido scans.
- **Remembrance / Refinement master**: Converts spare relics into stat boosts (fate breaking). In crossover, uses captured Zanpakuto fragments as catalysts; risks alerting spirits if overused.
- **Destiny selector / Path attuner**: Lets operatives pick which attribute improves on refinement. Doubles as a Kidō theoretician who rewrites seals to favor a Path’s strengths (e.g., Shunpo cadence for Rage builds).
- **Gambler / Curio broker**: Offers random rolls on Excaliburs/relics; in Hueco Mundo, trades mask shards for mimic prototypes that resist Cero/Hierro.

## Warm Snow protagonists and rivals in Bleach space
- **Bi-an analogue**: A Hell emissary or displaced soul who wields an Excalibur alongside a Zanpakuto-like spirit, able to see both mimic flaws and Shikai nuances. Functions as POV to bridge systems.
- **Five Great Clans**: Recast as noble houses in Soul Society who stockpile relics and sponsor Kido Corps research; some collude with Hell for Unique artifacts, others fund counter-tech.
- **Sect envoys**: Martial sect leaders (manuals/skills pages) become consultants to Kido Corps or underground trainers for Rukongai vigilantes, spreading Path doctrines under different banners.

## Logistics network and covers
- **Courier sparrows / Hell butterflies**: Mimic talismans piggyback on the communication network to send forge recipes and raid intel.
- **Smuggling routes**: Chains Path runs convoys through shadowed Senkaimon cracks; Paper Talismans Path tags funerary rites to slip mimics into barracks.
- **Safehouses**: Rukongai teahouses double as refinement dens; Dangai eddies serve as pop-up shops between acts; Hueco Mundo caves hide mask-shard caches for DLC arcs.

## Upgrade cadence per act
- **Act I (Rukongai Breach)**: Blacksmith limited to mimic repairs; Relic Vendor sells only rare/epic mimics. Refinement master offline (no catalysts yet).
- **Act II (Outer Wall)**: Forge-master gains one rarity-upgrade slot; Remembrance unlocked with confiscated Zanpakuto shards. Destiny selector appears in a sealed warehouse.
- **Act III (Dangai)**: Full refinement unlocked with time-dilated bonuses; Curio broker trades risky rolls for Cleaner scrap.
- **Act IV (Hell Forges)**: Mimic stamping at scale; Unique forging trials begin. Relic Vendor offers legendary mimics with suppressor seals.
- **Act V (Royal Gambit)**: Services go dark inside the palace—only prepped upgrades apply. Emergency rerolls possible at soul-cost. DLC Hueco Mundo loop reopens Curio trades for mask-infused relics.
