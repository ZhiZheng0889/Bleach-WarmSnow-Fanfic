# 秘籍 (Mìjí) / manuals (starter)

In the Chinese UI/wiki phrasing, **秘籍** are “manuals/secret arts” that function like **build-defining passive modifiers**.

This page is a **paraphrased** capture of the excerpt you pasted in chat. Names are kept as-is; effects are reworded for fic use.

## How to use this in fic
- Treat a **秘籍** as a sealed technique, pill formula, or scripture that “locks in” a rule for how your power behaves.
- The **rarity** tags can become in-world labels (common / rare / peerless).
- “Sect-exclusive” can be treated as lineage-only teachings.

## Rarity legend (from the excerpt)
- **普通**: common
- **稀有**: rare
- **绝世**: peerless
