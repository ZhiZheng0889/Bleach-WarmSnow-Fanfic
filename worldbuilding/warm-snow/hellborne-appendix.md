# Hellborne appendix (names + quick hooks)

Fic-friendly list of Excalibur names pulled from the wiki excerpt you provided, with very short paraphrases of what each weapon wants (items/skills/statuses it plays well with).

It’s intentionally not game-precise: use it as a prop list and a plotting aid.
