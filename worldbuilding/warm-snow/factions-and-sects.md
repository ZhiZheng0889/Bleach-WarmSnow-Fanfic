# Factions & Sects (clean draft)

Organized references for political powers and martial lineages to keep the fic consistent.

## Five Great Clans (story pillars)
The wiki frames Bi-an's crusade against "the Five Great Clans." Use these filled-in sketches as consistent anchors:
- **Clan Xu (Forge Lords)** — Domain: metals, foundries, weapon contracts. Public virtue: prosperity and "jobs." Vice: greed/extortion. Resource: iron veins and smithing guilds; taboo: no outsider may quench steel in clan forges without blood-price.
- **Clan Bai (Archive Keepers)** — Domain: scholarship, recordkeeping, law. Public virtue: scholarship/order. Vice: dogma and censorship. Resource: sealed libraries and spirit-scroll patents; taboo: speaking forbidden histories invites clan-sanctioned punishment.
- **Clan Yue (Riverwardens)** — Domain: trade routes, ports, grain taxes. Public virtue: stability/commerce. Vice: obsession with profit and smuggling. Resource: river checkpoints and toll fleets; taboo: traders must pour first profits into Yue coffers or be blacklisted.
- **Clan Shen (Jade Apothecaries)** — Domain: medicine, elixirs, hospitals. Public virtue: charity/healing. Vice: cruelty via human trials. Resource: apothecary monopolies and herb gardens; taboo: only Shen-approved elixirs may treat Warm Snow fevers.
- **Clan Long (Iron Banner)** — Domain: militias, bodyguards, wall defenses. Public virtue: protection. Vice: ambition and enforced conscription. Resource: conscript pools and armories; taboo: no soldier may refuse a Long banner call, even during festivals.

Guidelines when you adjust them:
- Pair a **signature vice** (greed, cruelty, dogma, obsession, cowardice) with a **public virtue** (order, prosperity, piety, scholarship, protection).
- Give each clan a resource or region it exploits (mines, trade routes, spirit wells, forge rights).
- Add a ritual or taboo each clan enforces; it drives conflict hooks.

## Sects (canon lineages and DLC additions)
Sects work like statue choices: you pick a doctrine, get a starter kit of skills, and unlock more aligned skills as you progress. Use these blurbs as quick reference and flavor.

- **Seven-Sword Shura** — Melee pressure, gap-closing, and execution windows.
  Starter skills: Cold Blood (guaranteed), Flurry, Hidden Strike.

- **Infinite Arhat** — Flying swords and ranged pressure from hovering blades.
  Starter skills: Infinity (guaranteed), Sword Rain, Sun Piercer. Unlock: first defeat of Sima Ying.
  Hallmarks: orbiting sword arrays, remote slashes from odd angles, meditative calm mid-fight.

- **Carousing Acalantha** — Flame/burning and liquor-themed intoxication combat.
  Starter skills: Burning Blade (guaranteed), Wine Soaked, Drunken Song. Unlock: first defeat of Lu Kunhai.

- **Thunderfury Vajra** — Lightning strikes, speed bursts, thunderbolts.
  Starter skills: Thunderbolt (guaranteed), Swift Shadow, Wild Thunder. Unlock: first defeat of Qin Wu.

- **Wheels of Solar and Lunar** — Burn + freeze duality; yin/yang tempo (DLC2).
  Starter skills: Solar-Lunar (guaranteed), Opposing Extremes, Chaos. Unlock: defeat a DLC2 boss.
  Hallmarks: alternating heat/cold pulses, enemies whiplashed between slow and sear, cyclical combat rhythm.

## Using sects in the fic
- Treat sects as **doctrines and lineages** that grant codified techniques, blessings, and taboos.
- In a Bleach crossover, sects can mirror **schools** (Kido traditions, clan arts, Hollow cults). Starter skills = core forms; unlocked skills = advanced spell lists.
- Let sect doctrines color gear choices: a Thunderfury disciple favors lightning relics; Seven-Sword Shura favors melee rage builders.

## Other factions to outline next
- **Imperial Guard**: how they police Warm Snow outbreaks; their loyalty split toward clans.
- **Bosses/Enemies**: which sects or clans they serve; what relics they guard.
- **Relics/Weapons custodians**: who controls forges, who smuggles mimics (ties to Hellborne pages).
