# Factions & Sects (clean draft)

Organized references for political powers and martial lineages to keep the fic consistent.

## Five Great Clans (story pillars)
The wiki frames Bi-an's crusade against "the Five Great Clans." Use these filled-in sketches as consistent anchors:
- **Clan Xu (Forge Lords)** - Domain: metals, foundries, weapon contracts. Public virtue: prosperity and "jobs." Vice: greed/extortion. Resource: iron veins and smithing guilds; taboo: no outsider may quench steel in clan forges without blood-price. Signature relic/technique: Blood Quench anvils that spike weapon rage generation. Seireitei entanglement: trades suppressor fittings to 12th Division rogues; enemy to 11th for arming Rukongai gangs.
- **Clan Bai (Archive Keepers)** - Domain: scholarship, recordkeeping, law. Public virtue: scholarship/order. Vice: dogma and censorship. Resource: sealed libraries and spirit-scroll patents; taboo: speaking forbidden histories invites clan-sanctioned punishment. Signature relic/technique: Sealing Scrolls that mute Zanpakuto whispers for three breaths. Ally/enemy: cooperates with Kido Corps archivists; hunted by Kuchiki records for suppressing noble lineages.
- **Clan Yue (Riverwardens)** - Domain: trade routes, ports, grain taxes. Public virtue: stability/commerce. Vice: obsession with profit and smuggling. Resource: river checkpoints and toll fleets; taboo: traders must pour first profits into Yue coffers or be blacklisted. Signature relic/technique: Tideway Tokens that bend trajectory of flying swords. Ally/enemy: bribes 4th Division quartermasters; clashes with 2nd Division patrols over illicit Senkaimon ferries.
- **Clan Shen (Jade Apothecaries)** - Domain: medicine, elixirs, hospitals. Public virtue: charity/healing. Vice: cruelty via human trials. Resource: apothecary monopolies and herb gardens; taboo: only Shen-approved elixirs may treat Warm Snow fevers. Signature relic/technique: Verdant Needles that inject poison or antidote on command. Ally/enemy: supplies black-market meds to 12th; stalked by 4th Division healers after patients vanish.
- **Clan Long (Iron Banner)** - Domain: militias, bodyguards, wall defenses. Public virtue: protection. Vice: ambition and enforced conscription. Resource: conscript pools and armories; taboo: no soldier may refuse a Long banner call, even during festivals. Signature relic/technique: Banner of Binding that rallies allies and slows foes in its shadow. Ally/enemy: trains private guards for nobles; resented by 13th Division for impressing souls from outer districts.

Guidelines when you adjust them:
- Pair a **signature vice** (greed, cruelty, dogma, obsession, cowardice) with a **public virtue** (order, prosperity, piety, scholarship, protection).
- Give each clan a resource or region it exploits (mines, trade routes, spirit wells, forge rights).
- Add a ritual or taboo each clan enforces; it drives conflict hooks.

## Sects (canon lineages and DLC additions)
Sects work like statue choices: you pick a doctrine, get a starter kit of skills, and unlock more aligned skills as you progress. Use these blurbs as quick reference and flavor.

  Hallmarks: alternating heat/cold pulses, enemies whiplashed between slow and sear, cyclical combat rhythm.

## Using sects in the fic
- Treat sects as **doctrines and lineages** that grant codified techniques, blessings, and taboos.
- In a Bleach crossover, sects can mirror **schools** (Kido traditions, clan arts, Hollow cults). Starter skills = core forms; unlocked skills = advanced spell lists.
- Let sect doctrines color gear choices: a Thunderfury disciple favors lightning relics; Seven-Sword Shura favors melee rage builders.

## Scene seeds (drop-in prompts)
- **Clan Yue x 2nd Division**: A Yue toll-captain hides Tideway Tokens in river lanterns; Soi Fon raids at night, only to find the tokens bend her shikai needles off-course until she tags them with Kido seals.
- **Clan Shen x 4th Division**: Shen medics run a "free clinic" that injects Verdant Needles; Unohana arrives, senses the poison inversion, and forces a needle to flip to antidote mid-surgery.
- **Seven-Sword Shura in Rukongai**: A disciple duels Long conscripts, using Killing Intent to stagger them so river smugglers can slip past with Hellborne mimics.
- **Infinite Arhat in Seireitei alleys**: Flying swords form a Blade Cage around a Bai archivist fleeing with banned scrolls; Byakuya's petals clash with the cage's orbit until Solar-Lunar pulses dim the petals.
- **Mother Trinity vs Hollow swarm**: Bleed stacks turn into Crimson Sea, corroding masks; Urahara notes the poison matches Shen trials, tying clans to Hollow experimentation.

## Other factions to outline next
- **Imperial Guard**: Polices Warm Snow outbreaks; splits loyalty between protecting peasants and enforcing clan edicts. Known relics: Whitewall Shields (blunt Warm Snow spores), Oath Halberds (bind deserters). Internal schism: Captain of the Outer Gates accepts Yue bribes; inner wall captain reports to Long.
- **Bosses/Enemies**: Tag each act's boss to a clan/sect sponsor (see Bleach crossover acts). Examples: talisman bombers -> Yue smugglers; frost wardens -> Bai archivists guarding Dangai records; forge overseers -> Xu-backed ritualists.
- **Relics/Weapons custodians**: Xu controls legal forges; Shen smuggles bio-relics; Yue moves mimics along rivers; Bai locks ritual scrolls; Long hoards military-issue mimics. Tie to Hellborne pages for mimic logistics.
- Cross-links: see Hellborne pages for mimic logistics and Bleach crossover acts/NPCs; see Imperial Guard and Bosses & Enemies pages for enforcement and antagonist mappings.

## Clan dossiers (quick reference)
- **Xu (Forge Lords)**: Vice/virtue: greed vs "jobs." Resource: iron veins, forge rights. Signature relic: Blood Quench anvil (rage generation). Alliances: sells suppressors to rogue 12th; rivals 11th. Sect tilt: Seven-Sword Shura disciples seek Xu metal; Mother Trinity despises their coercion.
- **Bai (Archive Keepers)**: Vice/virtue: censorship vs scholarship. Resource: sealed libraries. Signature relic: Sealing Scrolls (mute Zanpakuto whispers). Alliances: Kido Corps archivists; hunted by Kuchiki records. Sect tilt: Bitter River Bodhi favors their ice records; Thunderfury chafes at restrictions.
- **Yue (Riverwardens)**: Vice/virtue: profit vs stability. Resource: toll fleets, Senkaimon ferries. Signature relic: Tideway Tokens (bend flying sword paths). Alliances: bribes 4th; hunted by 2nd. Sect tilt: Infinite Arhat loves their flight lanes; Shadow-Walker freelances as river enforcers.
- **Shen (Jade Apothecaries)**: Vice/virtue: human trials vs healing. Resource: herb monopolies. Signature relic: Verdant Needles (poison/antidote on command). Alliances: black-market meds with 12th; opposed by 4th. Sect tilt: Mother Trinity uses their brews; Carousing Acalantha abuses their liquor tonics.
- **Long (Iron Banner)**: Vice/virtue: ambition vs protection. Resource: conscription pools. Signature relic: Banner of Binding (rally/slow field). Alliances: noble private guards; resented by 13th. Sect tilt: Thunderfury respects their drills; Seven-Sword Shura rebels against forced drafts.

## Extra scene seeds
- **Bai vault breach**: Urahara swaps a fake scroll while Bai seals mute his Zanpakuto; he uses Shadow Guard (Shadow-Walker) to slip the silence window.
- **Long drill vs Kenpachi**: Long banner slows Kenpachi's swing for once; he grins and tears it apart, revealing Banner of Binding cracks under raw Reiatsu spikes.
- **Shen trial ward**: Mayuri walks into a Shen clinic; Verdant Needles try to auto-inject him, but he flips their polarity to create antidote gas, exposing Shen's human trial ledgers.
