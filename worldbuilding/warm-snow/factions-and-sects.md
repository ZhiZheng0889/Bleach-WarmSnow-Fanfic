# Factions & sects (starter)

## Five Great Clans
The wiki home page describes Bi-an’s crusade as being “against the Five Great Clans”. Details for each clan still need to be verified and summarized.

Use this as a working placeholder so the fic stays consistent once you start naming them:

- Clan 1: TBD
- Clan 2: TBD
- Clan 3: TBD
- Clan 4: TBD
- Clan 5: TBD

### Clan portrayal guidelines
- Give each clan a **signature vice** (greed, cruelty, dogma, obsession, cowardice).
- Give each clan a **public virtue** (order, prosperity, piety, scholarship, protection) that masks the vice.

## Sects (named groups seen on the wiki home page)
The wiki home page includes a “favorite sect” poll that lists these sect names:

- Seven-Sword Shura
- Infinite Arhat
- Carousing Acalantha
- Thunderfury Vajra
- Bitter River Bodhi
- Mother Trinity

### What “sect” means (usable definition)
In the wiki’s structure, sects are effectively **statue choices** that:
- Define a combat focus (melee, flying swords, elements, status damage, etc.)
- Grant a small set of **starting skills**
- Unlock a larger pool of sect-aligned skills during the run

### Sect snapshots (paraphrased)
#### Seven-Sword Shura
- Focus: melee pressure and finding openings for lethal hits
- Starting skills: Cold Blood (guaranteed), plus Flurry and Hidden Strike

#### Infinite Arhat

- Starting skills: Infinity (guaranteed), plus Sword Rain and Sun Piercer
- Unlock requirement (meta): first-time defeat of Sima Ying

#### Carousing Acalantha
- Focus: flame/burning themes, with intoxication/"liquor" imagery
- Starting skills: Burning Blade (guaranteed), plus Wine Soaked and Drunken Song
- Unlock requirement (meta): first-time defeat of Lu Kunhai

#### Thunderfury Vajra
- Focus: lightning damage and thunderbolt-style strikes
- Starting skills: Thunderbolt (guaranteed), plus Swift Shadow and Wild Thunder
- Unlock requirement (meta): first-time defeat of Qin Wu

#### Bitter River Bodhi
- Focus: frost/freeze; lock enemies down then shatter/crush them
- Starting skills: Icy Cold (guaranteed), plus Bone Chill and White Frost

#### Mother Trinity
- Focus: bleed/poison themes; "blood poison" style effects
- Starting skills: Blood Poison (guaranteed), plus Blood Spatter and Infestation

### Additional sects referenced by the wiki’s skill index
- Shadow-Walker: parry/block emphasis; opportunistic counterattacks (unlock: purchase via Scarlet Treasure using Red Souls)
- Soul Blade Shura: conjuring blade spirits / flying swords (unlock: defeat a DLC2 boss)

### How to use sects in the fic
- Treat sects as **doctrines + techniques** (a worldview that shapes how they fight, heal, punish, or bargain).
- In a Bleach crossover, sects can map cleanly to **schools** or **lineages** (like Kidō traditions, clan techniques, or Hollow cults).

## Other likely factions to capture next
From the wiki’s navigation and page list, these appear to exist as categories or groups worth extracting later:

- Imperial Guard
- Bosses / Enemies (as story antagonists)
- Relics / Excaliburs (as artifacts tied to factions)
