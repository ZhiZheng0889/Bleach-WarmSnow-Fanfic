# Hellborne Arsenal (Weapons, Relics, Technologies)

A scene-ready catalog of **powerful Hellborne artifacts** designed to fit the setting’s pillars:

- **Floors**: higher-tier tools require higher responsibility, not “noble blood.”
- **Communist core**: ownership is communal; custody rotates; audit trails matter.
- **Tech/spellcraft feedback loop**: non-combat infrastructure reliably increases combat power (coordination, endurance, survivability).
- **Blueprint culture**: most systems have a reproducible “field procedure,” even if the *Unique core* cannot be copied.

## Governance rules (use these in prose)

- **Custodian rotation**: Unique tools are held by a *custodian seat* for a time window (a duty), then reassigned.
- **Audit marks**: every issuance leaves a trace mark (forge batch, seal phrase, or ledger hash). The mark is political protection and also a vulnerability.
- **Floor locks**: some items are keyed to a Floor not by “power gating,” but by required discipline (counting, restraint, maintenance).

## Unique weapons (Path anchors)

These are singular artifacts (or a singular “core” with replaceable fittings). Mimics can copy silhouettes, but not the deep resonance.

### 1) Iron Commune Halberd (Thunder/Long joint project)
- **Type**: Unique weapon core + swappable fittings
- **Wants**: coordinated movement; count-calls; a spotter network
- **Does**: turns a squad into a single “strike body” by letting the wielder *borrow timing* from allies (micro-sync); devastating against Kido nets and street-level formations
- **Cost**: the wielder’s nervous system frays; after overuse, they lose independent timing (tremor, delayed reactions)
- **Counterplay**: disrupt the count (noise seals, false count-songs); isolate the wielder from allies
- **Scene hook**: the weapon is strongest when the wielder refuses personal glory and follows the count like a worker at a press

### 2) Furnace-Seed Greatshield (Furnace/Clinic)
- **Type**: Unique relic-armor hybrid
- **Wants**: sustained triage; heat discipline; maintenance rituals
- **Does**: deploys a short-lived **ward bloom** that eats incoming “status” effects (poison/freeze/curse) by converting them into heat that can be vented as steam concealment
- **Cost**: if venting is mistimed, it cooks allies’ lungs; requires strict drill and respirator strips
- **Counterplay**: cold-binding to lock the vents; wide-area fire to force overheating
- **Scene hook**: used as a clinic’s last line—combat and care sharing the same tool

### 3) Chain-Index Spear (Chains/Paper)
- **Type**: Unique weapon
- **Wants**: names, ledgers, and proofs
- **Does**: strikes “paper targets” (warrants, seals, registry threads) as if they were flesh; can sever a sweep order by pinning its issuing seal to a wall
- **Cost**: every use writes the wielder deeper into the archive; the spear starts to “know” them like a file (easier to track, easier to classify)
- **Counterplay**: blank-wax seals; shifting authority to oral orders; burning paper in advance
- **Scene hook**: the spear forces the bureaucracy to fight in public, on the page

### 4) Wraith Loom Sabers (Specters/Flying Swords)
- **Type**: Pair of Unique blades that “weave” afterimages
- **Wants**: misdirection; controlled fear; rehearsed routes
- **Does**: weaves a corridor-thin afterimage grid that makes pursuers misjudge distance (they arrive late, swing early)
- **Cost**: the grid invites corridor attention; the more it’s used, the more the “between” remembers the pattern
- **Counterplay**: sensory captains who ignore sight; anchor talismans that thicken space; floodlights/count-songs to stabilize perception
- **Scene hook**: a weapon that is powerful precisely because it’s used sparingly (discipline as power)

### 5) Blood-Quota Needle (Blood/Shen)
- **Type**: Unique implement (weapon/medical)
- **Wants**: honest accounting; consent; “no blood without record”
- **Does**: converts battlefield blood into emergency stamina and clotting for allies, but only if the wielder records the withdrawal into a ledger strip (blood becomes a tracked resource)
- **Cost**: forging consent into procedure creates politics; enemies can target the ledger to destabilize morale
- **Counterplay**: destroy records; force chaos so nothing can be written; induce mass bleeding to overwhelm the quota
- **Scene hook**: the Needle is a communist relic: it refuses to work when blood becomes privilege

## Unique relic engines (infrastructure that becomes power)

### 6) Common Seal Press (Paper/Bai fork)
- **Type**: Unique machine-relic
- **Wants**: rotation schedules; public witness; ink discipline
- **Does**: stamps **counter-seals** that are hard to counterfeit because they include a moving “witness phrase” (a rotating slogan/number sequence)
- **Cost**: whoever controls the press controls legitimacy; must be kept mobile and audited
- **Counterplay**: steal the press; seed fake witness phrases; force the press to stamp in panic
- **Scene hook**: a battle over a machine that decides whether food counts as “theft”

### 7) Lantern-Web Relay (Thunder/Paper)
- **Type**: Unique coordination network (portable nodes)
- **Wants**: routes, lantern lanes, count songs
- **Does**: turns street signals into a low-tech “internet” for squads; can keep coordination alive even when Kido nets jam voice and sight
- **Cost**: creates a map of trust; if compromised, it exposes every route
- **Counterplay**: capture one node and back-trace; use false lantern patterns to cause stampedes
- **Scene hook**: a raid fails because the Lantern-Web keeps civilians moving like a trained river

### 8) Triage Condenser Array (Clinic/Furnace)
- **Type**: Unique clinic technology
- **Wants**: non-combat labor; steady routines
- **Does**: condenses ambient spiritual residue into sterile heat and clean water; clinics stop depending on noble supply chains
- **Cost**: emits a faint “clean” signature that skilled trackers can detect
- **Counterplay**: poison the water input; sabotage with subtle contamination; force the array to run beyond capacity
- **Scene hook**: a captain realizes the Hellborne are winning because people stop dying of preventable sickness

## Mimic-tier power items (mass issue, dangerous)

These are the ones you can put into squads and cause chaos with.

### 9) Oath-Collar Tags (Paper/Chains)
- **Type**: mass-produced tags (rare/epic mimics)
- **Wants**: compliance theater
- **Does**: forces a short “oath posture” in the wearer when confronted by authority phrases; can be used defensively (resist intimidation) or offensively (freeze dissenters)
- **Failure**: tags misfire under strong Reiatsu and lock the wrong person
- **Counterplay**: shred the tag; disrupt the phrase; sensory reading to detect the tag’s cadence

### 10) Ash-Glass Grenades (Furnace)
- **Type**: disposable tech weapon
- **Wants**: denial zones
- **Does**: bursts a glittering ash that sticks to warded thread and seal ink, revealing coordination lines and hidden talismans
- **Failure**: in rain, it becomes a slurry that blinds allies
- **Counterplay**: water; wind; sacrificial outer seals

### 11) River-Null Boots (Yue/Thunder)
- **Type**: gear relic (epic/legendary mimics)
- **Wants**: movement discipline
- **Does**: reduces “threshold drag” when crossing ward lines; lets smugglers move through partial containment without tripping alarms
- **Failure**: boots “echo” the last ward crossed, letting trackers follow a ghost imprint
- **Counterplay**: multi-layer wards; bait-wards; switchback routes

### 12) Mirror-Splinter Plates (Specters)
- **Type**: armor insert relic
- **Wants**: deception under pressure
- **Does**: breaks the wearer’s silhouette into two false readings for a few counts; good against sensory targeting and Bankai profiling
- **Failure**: under captain pressure, the plate can fracture and permanently “double” the wearer’s signature (making stealth impossible)
- **Counterplay**: sustained pressure to force fracture; binding nets that ignore signature

## Writing shortcuts

If you want quick “power escalation” on the page:

- Give a squad **Lantern-Web Relay + Ash-Glass Grenades** (coordination + reveal) and suddenly patrols can’t keep secrets.
- Give a custodian a **Common Seal Press** and suddenly the political fight becomes “who owns legitimacy.”
- Put a Unique weapon in the scene, then show the **cost** immediately (tremor, lungs, tracking mark) to keep it grounded.
