# Bleach crossover: Acts and arcs
How to deploy the Warm Snow run structure as a Hellborne incursion through Soul Society (and beyond).

## Act map (Warm Snow -> Bleach)
- **Act I: Rukongai Breach (Imperial Outskirts analogue)**  
  Objective: Seed rare/epic mimic relics among black-market runners; stress-test how quickly Shinigami confiscate them.  
  Set piece: Warm Snow blizzard rolls over outer districts, muffling Kido sensors. Chains Path opens micro-Hellmouths in alleyways.  
  Boss analogue: A gunpowder lord becomes a talisman bomber with mimic relic grenades; defeat drops a guaranteed legendary mimic for early captain counters.
- **Act II: Seireitei Outer Wall (Capital/Palace analogue)**  
  Objective: Smuggle a Unique relic inside under the cover of confiscations; install suppressor seals.  
  Set piece: Paper Talismans Path uses stolen konso rites as entry tickets; Furnace Path forges “mundane” Zanpakuto shells to hide Excaliburs.  
  Boss analogue: An elite sect guardian becomes a Gotei gate captain; fight emphasizes barrier layering and anti-kido Lightning Path traps.
- **Act III: Dangai Chasms (Mountain/Frozen fortress analogue)**  
  Objective: Build a time-dilated forge to iterate mimics; sabotage the Cleaner.  
  Set piece: Frost Path creates frozen time pockets; Flying Swords Path navigates Koryu currents with lightning rails.  
  Boss analogue: A frost general becomes a Dangai warden wielding a Unique mimic-stabilized sword; arena punishes static footing.
- **Act IV: Hell Forges under Senzaikyu (Industrial furnace analogue)**  
  Objective: Mass-produce legendary mimics and bind a Soul King scrap into three Unique Excaliburs.  
  Set piece: Furnace Path runs mobile foundries; Chains Path drags condemned souls as fuel. Warm Snow falls upward as heat shimmer.  
  Boss analogue: Demon monks become Kido Corps defectors overseeing the forge; their Bankai-equivalent ritual must be interrupted before full charge.
- **Act V: Royal Key Gambit (Inner palace analogue)**  
  Objective: Test Unique weapons against Squad Zero; steal a fragment of the Royal Key forging schema.  
  Set piece: Blade/Frost/Furnace Leaders spearhead the assault, supported by Specters afterimages that spoof Zanpakuto spirits.  
  Boss analogue: A multi-phase duel with a Royal Guard emissary; terrain shifts between sealed corridors and open reishi lakes.
- **Ash of Nightmare (DLC) -> Hueco Mundo incursion**  
  Objective: Weaponize mimics against hollows/Arrancar, harvest their masks as relics, and learn Quincy counters.  
  Set piece: Warm Snow manifests as ash that erodes Garganta walls; Path operatives ride Ceros as lightning rails.  
  Boss analogue: Nightmare beast becomes an Arrancar lord whose Resurrección corrupts mimics; victory yields mask-shard relics for hybrid builds.

## Arc beats to weave across acts
- **Escalation rhythm**: Each act escalates mimic rarity in the field (rare -> epic -> legendary) while keeping Unique artifacts hidden until Act IV/V confrontations.
- **Investigation pressure**: Kido Corps and Mayuri/Urahara counter-tech advance per act; operatives respond with new suppressor talismans.
- **Bankai baiting**: Acts II–III center on provoking Bankai releases to record silhouettes with Paper Talismans Path prototypes; Act V deploys refined recordings as feints.
- **Soul supply lines**: Blue Souls (disguised as reishi motes) fuel forge upgrades between acts; raids on Seireitei warehouses or Hueco Mundo reishi veins refill stock.
- **Warm Snow as veil**: Use the blizzard as sensory dampener early; later, turn it into a curse that overheats Zanpakuto spirits, forcing captains to manage blade fatigue mid-fight.
