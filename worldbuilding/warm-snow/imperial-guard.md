# Imperial Guard

Police Warm Snow outbreaks, protect clan interests, and control movement between districts. Split loyalties make them both tools of oppression and potential allies.

## Structure
- **Outer Gates Command**: patrols Rukongai walls, issues travel permits, collects tolls. Often bribed by Clan Yue riverwardens.
- **Inner Wall Command**: stationed near the palace and clan manors; answers to Clan Long influence.
- **Rapid Response Units**: small squads trained to contain Warm Snow flares and riots; rotate between districts.

## Standard kit (relics/arms)
- **Whitewall Shields**: alchemized to blunt Warm Snow spores; double as riot cover.
- **Oath Halberds**: bind deserters or oath-breakers in place for three breaths.
- **Seal Lanterns**: light that reveals mimic relic signatures; weak against Hellborne suppressors.
- **Banner Sigils**: borrowed from Long—miniature Banner of Binding that slows crowds.

## Loyalties and cracks
- **Outer Gates**: captain takes Yue bribes to wave tolls for smugglers; 2nd Division and Soi Fon monitor them.
- **Inner Wall**: captain reports to Clan Long; enforces conscription and suppresses protests.
- **Archivist Liaison**: Bai scribes embed to censor reports; creates friction with rank-and-file who see Hollow risks ignored.

## Hooks for scenes
- Guard raid backfires when Seal Lanterns tag Hellborne mimics, triggering Chain pulls to Hell.
- Whitewall line holds against Warm Snow blizzard until Thunderfury disciples short out the sigils.
- Oath Halberd pins a deserter; Urahara slips a counter-sigil to spoof loyalty.
