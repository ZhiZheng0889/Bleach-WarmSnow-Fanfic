# Glossary (starter)

This is a **working** glossary: short, consistent meanings you can use in prose. Items marked **TBD** should be verified against the wiki before locking them in.

## Core terms

- **Five Great Clans**: The major power blocs Bi-an targets in a crusade. (Names/domains TBD.)

## Sects
- **Seven-Sword Shura**: Melee-focused sect; leans toward bursty “find weakness, finish hard” techniques.

- **Rarity (weapon)**: Rare/Epic/Legendary/Mythic; higher rarity usually means more stat lines and stronger unique effects.

- **Sheath**: A core combat action in the game’s vocabulary; many effects trigger “upon sheathing.”
- **Sheath cooldown**: A weapon stat line that reduces how long you wait between sheath uses.
- **Rage gain**: A weapon stat line that increases how quickly you build rage.
- **Distill (weapon)**: Converting a weapon into Blue Souls.
- **Blue Souls**: A currency-like resource; weapons can be distilled into Blue Souls with payout scaling by rarity.

## Skills & selection
- **Skill**: Primarily a passive ability gained during the run.
- **Statue / worship**: Your run-start sect choice; grants starting skills and biases later skill options.
- **Tome Remnant**: A pick-1-of-3 skill reward event.

## Additional terms (CN UI/wiki phrasing)
