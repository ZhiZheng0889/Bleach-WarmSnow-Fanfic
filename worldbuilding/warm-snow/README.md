# Warm Snow (暖雪) Worldbuilding

This folder collects **paraphrased** setting notes and a working glossary for adapting *Warm Snow* elements into this fanfic.

## What we have so far
- High-level premise and tone (from the wiki home page).
- A starter list of named concepts to consistently reuse (Bi-an, Five Great Clans, named sects).
- System notes for **weapons** (rarity, attribute rolls, distilling) and **relics** (slots, refining, base/DLC name lists).
