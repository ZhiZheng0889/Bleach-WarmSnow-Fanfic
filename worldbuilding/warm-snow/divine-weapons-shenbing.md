# Divine weapons (神兵)

In some Warm Snow references, certain weapons have a **“divine weapon” trait** (神兵特效): an extra rule layered on top of normal weapon stats.

For fic use, you can treat a 神兵 trait as a blade’s **signature “vow/quirk”**: it only *wakes up* under specific conditions (a matching relic, a paired technique, an elemental state, etc.), and it can change how a fight looks and escalates.

## What a “Shenbing trait” usually looks like
- **Conditional triggers**: “when you have X”, “when effect Y procs”, “when target is Z status”.
- **Synergy wiring**: many traits reference specific relics/manuals/skills (build-defining combos).
- **Two-layer effects** (common pattern): a base boost, then a stronger “if you also have …” clause.

## Examples (paraphrased from biligame)
These are intentionally **short paraphrases** to keep them story-friendly; the wiki entries include exact numbers and named synergies.

### Sect-tied examples
- **万钧** (圣威怒雷金刚专属): If you’re running the sect’s thunder kit, lightning-triggered “rage thunder” effects can also detonate a secondary shock around the target; with a second lightning piece, the thunder payoff becomes reliably stronger.
- **雷息** (圣威怒雷金刚专属): Ties into the sect’s dash/strike rhythm—your finisher can “upgrade” your next lightning dash, and you can temporarily force multiple dashes to count as the upgraded version.
- **炽焰** (神饮明王专属): Overcharges the sect’s burning-blade proc and throws an extra fire slash outward when it triggers (turning single-target burst into cleave).
- **酒神** (神饮明王专属): Reinforces the sect’s “detonate” style—explosions hit harder and spread outward as a big expanding ring.
- **堕日** (无量尊者专属): Your sun-beam style hit causes an added explosion; the follow-up blast is bigger and substantially stronger.
- **骤雨** (无量尊者专属): When you enter the “sword immortal / sword god” cadence, flying-sword damage spikes, and the weapon removes a gating limitation tied to the sect’s sword-heat mechanic.
- **无名** (七剑修罗专属): Buffs the weapon’s “ride the momentum” damage and improves the trigger rate of the multi-sword follow-up; when both are active, the multi-sword hit can also trigger the momentum-cut on contact.
- **幻灭** (七剑修罗专属): If your cold-blood trigger procs, it speeds up your sword-return loop; while sword-return is cooling down, all damage is noticeably boosted.
- **百足** (三尸慈姑娘专属): When poison-blade procs, it adds a heavy extra melee hit; with an additional time/mark effect, poison-blade procs can also trigger that follow-up.
- **血虱** (三尸慈姑娘专属): Converts your “blood bullet” byproducts into a lingering blood-parasite that attacks nearby enemies and sustains you; after enough damage, it bursts and then returns.

### General examples
- **黄泉**: When “extreme cold” triggers, it can create a patch of freezing under the target that damages over time and effectively counts enemies inside as frozen; the zone grows as it keeps dealing damage.

## Catalog (starter)
This is the current set visible via the biligame “神兵” index query. Many entries have rich combo text; expand individual ones later as needed for scenes.

## Notes for fic adaptation
- If you want 神兵 to feel *rare*, treat them like **named blades** whose effects are “locked” behind a matching relic/manual.
- If you want them to feel *systemic*, treat 神兵 traits as a **refinement layer**: any weapon can awaken a divine trait when carried by the right kind of cultivator.
