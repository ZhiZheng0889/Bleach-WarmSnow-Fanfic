# Divine weapons (shenbing)

In Warm Snow, some weapons carry a **divine trait** (shenbing): a conditional “vow” that wakes when specific synergies or states are met. Use them as named blades with unlock requirements.

## How shenbing traits behave
- Conditional triggers: “when target is frozen,” “when lightning procs,” “when this relic/manual is held.”
- Synergy wiring: traits often call out specific relics/manuals/skills; think build-defining combos.
- Two-layer effects: a base boost, then a stronger clause if you meet a second condition.

## Paraphrased examples (flavor, not numbers)
- **Thunder lineage blade**: lightning dash gains a second strike; with a second lightning piece, dashes chain as the stronger version.
- **Flame cleaver**: burning-blade procs throw an extra fire slash, turning single-target hits into cleave.
- **Explosion greatsword**: detonate-style hits expand into a large ring; with the right manual, the ring gains bonus damage.
- **Sun-beam edge**: beam hits cause an added explosion; explosion grows when a sun-state buff is active.
- **Sword-immortal saber**: removes a flying-sword heat cap and spikes damage when in “sword god” stance.
- **Momentum cutter**: “ride the momentum” hits boost multi-sword follow-up; while swords are returning, overall damage is increased.
- **Poison fang**: poison procs add a heavy extra melee hit; with a time/mark effect, poison also triggers that follow-up.
- **Blood parasite**: converts blood bullets into a lingering parasite that attacks nearby foes and sustains you; bursts after damage and returns.
- **Extreme cold blade**: creates a freezing patch under enemies when extreme-cold triggers; zone grows as it damages and counts enemies as frozen.

## Using shenbing in the fic
- Treat shenbing as rare blades that demand **build commitments** (relic+manual+status).
- Let captains recognize the “vow” and counter by denying the condition (e.g., dispel poison, avoid freeze).
- Hellborne mimics can copy silhouettes but usually fail to meet the divine trigger reliably.
