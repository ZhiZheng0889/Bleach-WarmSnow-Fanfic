# Technology evolution: Soul Society side

A consistency guide for how "technology" advances on the Bleach/Soul Society side in response to Warm Snow artifacts, Hellborne methods, and mimic proliferation.

Treat this as **institutional engineering**: the Gotei 13 and Kido Corps iterate through doctrine, seals, labs, and enforcement more than through mass-manufactured hardware.

## Baseline (before Warm Snow exposure)
- **Kido is the core platform**: standardized spellcraft, barrier design, and seal logic.
- **Mobility is controlled infrastructure**: gates, authorized passages, patrol routes, and regulated movement.
- **Medical and research capacity exists**: enough to analyze anomalies, but constrained by politics, secrecy, and jurisdiction.
- **Doctrine is part of tech**: squads fight differently, and those defaults dictate what gets funded and standardized.

## Tech pillars (what can "advance")
### Detection and attribution
- Better "sensors" look like: tighter patrol patterns, improved anomaly thresholds, and fewer false positives.
- The key leap is **attribution**: distinguishing Warm Snow effects from hollow activity, from rogue experiments, from ordinary crime.

### Containment and quarantine
- Barriers evolve toward **layering**: capture, isolate, purge/sterilize, then validate.
- Containment protocols become portable: tags, cordons, temporary wards that squads can deploy without specialists.

### Forensics and reverse-engineering (research units)
- Confiscated relics drive a cycle: catalog → stress-test → failure analysis → countermeasure.
- The most valuable product is a **counter-template** (a reusable seal or procedure), not a one-off gadget.

### Logistics and confiscation
- Storage evolves from "lock it away" to **chain-of-custody**: seals that record handling, transfers, and tamper attempts.
- Enforcement advances as paperwork plus force: consistent seizure rules, standardized evidence sealing, controlled disposal.

### Field doctrine upgrades (squads)
- Squads adapt via **loadouts**: prewritten seal strips, standardized antidotes, barrier stakes, and relay signals.
- The most realistic improvement is **inter-squad compatibility**: the same emergency kit works in multiple districts.

## Escalation timeline (usable beats)
### Phase 0: Platform confidence
- Most threats are assumed to be known categories; response is fast but sometimes misclassified.
- Research acts cautiously: policy and approvals slow adaptation.

### Phase 1: Anomaly shock
- Warm Snow conditions introduce failure modes: muted detection, heat-in-cold sensory confusion, spiritual fatigue.
- First countermeasures are crude: broader cordons, more patrols, stricter confiscation.

### Phase 2: Template war
- Specialists produce reusable counter-seals, quarantine procedures, and training drills.
- Captains begin to demand metrics: how many incidents, how many confiscations, which districts repeat.

### Phase 3: Arms-race governance
- New rules appear: artifact handling tiers, district restrictions, clinic reporting requirements.
- The conflict shifts from "can we stop it" to "who controls the response" (jurisdiction fights, secrecy, blame).

## How this shows up on the page
- Advances read as **policy plus practice**: a new tag, a revised patrol map, a better quarantine drill.
- Counter-tech is often invisible until it works: a seal that quietly prevents a relic from syncing, a form that flags a repeat smuggler.

## Hooks (drop-in prompts)
- A new confiscation tier is introduced; squads exploit loopholes to keep trophies or deny rivals.
- Quarantine protocols save a district but create resentment; locals start hiding symptoms.
- A research memo leaks and becomes black-market doctrine for Warm Snow smugglers.
