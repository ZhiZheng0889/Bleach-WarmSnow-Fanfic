# Technology evolution: Warm Snow side

A consistency guide for how "technology" progresses in the Warm Snow sphere (Five Great Clans, sect lineages, Imperial Guard, and black-market Hellborne logistics).

This is not modern industry. Treat it as **craft + ritual engineering**: improvements look like better materials, cleaner seals, repeatable procedures, and supply-chain control.

## Baseline (before Bleach contact)
- **Forge-tech is political**: Clan Xu controls metal quality, quench rites, and who gets what alloy.
- **Seal-tech is bureaucratic**: Clan Bai controls scroll formats, censorship marks, and legal/illegal talisman patterns.
- **Distribution is the weapon**: Clan Yue turns any artifact into a strategic asset via ferries, tolls, and smuggling routes.
- **Bio-tech is plausible horror**: Clan Shen iterates elixirs via trials, poison/antidote inversion, and ritual sterility.
- **Mass force is logistics**: Clan Long scales conscription, drills, banner-fields, and armory discipline.

## Tech pillars (what can "advance")
### Materials (Xu)
- Better steel is less about purity and more about **spirit conduction**: blades that hold intent without warping.
- Standardization emerges as **forge marks** (traceable batches) and **quench recipes** tied to a patron rite.

### Seals, contracts, and compliance (Bai)
- Scrolls evolve from "one-off curses" to **repeatable templates**: stamps, countersigns, and expiration clauses.
- The key innovation is **interoperability**: the same seal can bind a sword, a person, or a doorway if the wording is right.

### Distribution and concealment (Yue)
- Smuggling tech evolves toward **concealment protocols**: lacquer layers, coin-tokens, false ledgers, and decoy cargos.
- The practical breakthrough is **routing**: moving artifacts faster than investigations can follow.

### Elixirs and controlled harm (Shen)
- Elixirs become "industrial" when Shen can control **dose, timing, and side-effects** reliably.
- The dark leap is **payload elixirs**: medicine that carries a second function (tracking, addiction, delayed curse).

### Mass discipline and field doctrine (Long)
- Long tech evolves as **doctrine**: standardized formations that assume relic availability.
- The signature upgrade is **banner-field refinement**: tighter slow-fields, cleaner rally effects, fewer friendly-fire failures.

## Escalation timeline (usable beats)
### Phase 0: Guild era (status quo)
- Relics are rare enough to be mythic; most conflict is about who gets access.
- The clans compete on legitimacy: licenses, temple endorsements, "public virtue" campaigns.

### Phase 1: Scarcity hacks (early crisis)
- Counterfeits rise: fake seals, cut elixirs, re-stamped forge marks.
- Yue-led networks normalize **modular props**: tokens, talisman strips, and detachable fittings.

### Phase 2: Repeatability (arms race inside the clans)
- Xu publishes "safe" standards while hiding true recipes; Shen runs parallel labs.
- Bai formalizes seal language; Long rewrites drill manuals to assume banner support.

### Phase 3: Weaponized bureaucracy (late crisis)
- The most dangerous tech is paperwork: confiscation rites, "legal" conscription tags, clinic intake forms.
- Progress looks like **lower friction**: fewer steps from idea → fielded tool.

## How this shows up on the page
- Upgrades arrive as **procedures** (new stamp, new quench step, new clinic form) more than gadgets.
- Breakthroughs create **new social leverage**: who can deny care, who can certify a blade, who can seize contraband.

## Hooks (drop-in prompts)
- A Xu batch fails in the field; blame shifts to Shen "contamination" while Yue moves the real culprit.
- Bai introduces an expiration clause that causes seals to die mid-fight; Long demands exceptions for soldiers.
- Shen releases a "free" fever tonic that secretly tags patients for later retrieval.
