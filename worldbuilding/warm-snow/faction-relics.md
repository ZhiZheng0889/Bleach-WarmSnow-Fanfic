# Faction Relics & Props

Quick props tied to the Five Great Clans for scenes, interrogations, and political leverage.

- **Xu (Forge Lords)**
  - *Blood Quench Anvil* (artifact): Grants +rage gain when you quench steel in blood; cracks suppressor seals nearby.
  - *Iron Ledger Seal*: Brand used on forged contracts; glows if a weapon was forged without Xu sanction.
  - Failure mode: Overheats near Royal Guard Reiatsu, warping the steel.
  - Scene hook: 11th Division finds Blood Quench slag; traces Xu bribes to Rukongai gangs.

- **Bai (Archive Keepers)**
  - *Silence Scroll Case*: Dampens Zanpakuto whispers within earshot; fragile to thunder shocks.
  - *Censor’s Mask*: Filters Warm Snow spores; also blocks Reiatsu signatures, used to smuggle banned scrolls.
  - Failure mode: Masks can suffocate wearers if overloaded with Reiatsu.
  - Scene hook: Urahara swaps a mask to pass Kido Corps checkpoints; Byakuya senses the silence field.

- **Yue (Riverwardens)**
  - *Tideway Token*: Coin that curves flying sword paths along water; breaks if removed from flowing reishi.
  - *Lantern Cache*: Decorative river lantern hiding mimic relics; lights with Seal Lantern fuel.
  - Failure mode: Tokens short in dry zones, turning into shrapnel charms.
  - Scene hook: Soi Fon chases smugglers; lanterns arc her shikai aside until she tags the tokens with Kido.

- **Shen (Jade Apothecaries)**
  - *Verdant Needle Kit*: Swappable poison/antidote cartridges; glows when inserted into Warm Snow patients.
  - *Jade Inhaler*: Mists that soothe fever—or sedate captives for trials.
  - Failure mode: Needles corrode near Hollow reiatsu, reversing to self-poison.
  - Scene hook: Unohana flips needles to antidote mid-surgery; exposes Shen human trial records.

- **Long (Iron Banner)**
  - *Banner of Binding* (standard): Creates a slow field and rally buff; tears under heavy Reiatsu spikes.
  - *Conscription Tag*: Tattoos that heat up when draft-dodgers flee; trackable by Long captains.
  - Failure mode: Conscription tags can be spoofed by Urahara’s counter-sigils, turning them into flares.
  - Scene hook: Kenpachi rips a Banner, triggering a Long captain to confront him over conscripts.

## Misc props for crossovers
- *Seal Lantern (Guard issue)*: Reveals mimic signatures; shorts out against Thunderfury pulses.
- *Oath Halberd (Guard issue)*: Pins deserters for three breaths; Hellborne Chains can yank it free.
- *Counter-sigil (Urahara/Mayuri)*: Rewrites Bai seals to display false archives; risks backlash if overheated.
