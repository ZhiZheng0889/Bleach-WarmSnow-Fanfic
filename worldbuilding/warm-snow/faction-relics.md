# Faction Relics & Props

Quick props tied to the Five Great Clans for scenes, interrogations, and political leverage.

- **Bai (Archive Keepers)**
  - *Silence Scroll Case*: Dampens Zanpakuto whispers within earshot; fragile to thunder shocks.
  - *Censor's Mask*: Filters Warm Snow spores; also blocks Reiatsu signatures, used to smuggle banned scrolls.

  - *Tideway Token*: Coin that curves flying sword paths along water; breaks if removed from flowing reishi.
  - *Lantern Cache*: Decorative river lantern hiding mimic relics; lights with Seal Lantern fuel.
  - Failure mode: Tokens short in dry zones, turning into shrapnel charms.

- **Long (Iron Banner)**
  - *Banner of Binding* (standard): Creates a slow field and rally buff; tears under heavy Reiatsu spikes.
  - *Conscription Tag*: Tattoos that heat up when draft-dodgers flee; trackable by Long captains.
  - Failure mode: Conscription tags can be spoofed by Urahara's counter-sigils, turning them into flares.
  - Scene hook: Kenpachi rips a Banner, triggering a Long captain to confront him over conscripts.

## Misc props for crossovers
