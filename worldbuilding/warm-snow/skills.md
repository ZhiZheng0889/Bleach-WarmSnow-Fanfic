# Skills system (starter)

In the wiki’s framing, **skills** are primarily **passive abilities** gained during a run.

## How you get skills
### Starting choice (statues)
At the start of a run you choose a statue/sect to “worship”, which grants an initial set of skills. This also biases later skill offerings toward that sect.

### Mid-run choice (Tome Remnant)
A “Tome Remnant” event offers a pick-1-of-3 skill choice.
- The offered skills are random.
- They draw from either the worshipped sect’s pool or from “common” skills.
- A shop upgrade can allow a single reroll of the offer.

Tome Remnants can appear from multiple sources (skill rooms, bosses, elite encounters, shops, and some run-start upgrades).

## Common skills (what they look like)
Common skills often read like **small, consistent percentage bonuses**, e.g. "Blessing of …" entries that increase max HP, attack, defense, elemental damage, attack speed, or reduce sheath cooldown.

## Sect skill pools
The wiki enumerates skills by sect. The visible sect list includes:
- Seven-Sword Shura (melee emphasis)
- Infinite Arhat (flying-sword emphasis)
- Carousing Acalantha (flame/burning emphasis)
- Thunderfury Vajra (lightning emphasis)
- Bitter River Bodhi (frost/freeze emphasis)
- Mother Trinity (bleed/poison emphasis)
- Shadow-Walker (parry/block emphasis)
- Soul Blade Shura (blade-spirit / flying-sword conjuring emphasis)
- Wheels of Solar and Lunar (burn + freeze duality)

## How to use this in fic
- Treat “skills” as **codified techniques** or **blessings** that stack into a build philosophy.
- Treat the statue choice as a **vow** or **initiation**: it’s a great way to justify why a character’s toolkit coheres.

One practical crossover anchor: many weapons/relics/skills explicitly care about **status states** (burning, frozen, poisoned, bleeding, stunned, drunk). You can treat those as named “afflictions” that different sects specialize in causing or exploiting.

## Sect skill catalogs (paraphrased examples)
These are **short, fic-friendly paraphrases** of example skills listed on the wiki’s Skills page tables. Use them as inspiration, not as rigid game-accurate text.

### Seven-Sword Shura (melee pressure)
Example normal skills that fit the theme:
- **Annihilation**: build stacks by striking enemies; cash stacks in for a big hit.
- **Bloodlust Blade / Bloodthirst**: reward aggressive chaining of kills or hits.
- **Rend / Severe Wound**: add bleeding-style damage and/or amplify damage to wounded targets.
- **Ruthless**: spikes damage when the enemy is vulnerable (e.g., low HP or debuffed).
- **Sword Fusion**: reinforces “one blade, one kill” by escalating damage after consecutive strikes.

### Infinite Arhat (flying-sword focus)
Example normal skills that fit the theme:
- **Sword Mastery / Blademaster**: steady scaling for flying-sword output.
- **Piercing Blade**: improves penetration/through-hit behavior.
- **Arc Light Blade**: adds elemental/arc effects to flying-sword hits.
- **Critical Strike**: pushes crit reliability or crit payoff.
- **Sword of Heaven / Sword God**: capstone-style multipliers when the build is fully online.

### Carousing Acalantha (burning + intoxication imagery)
Example normal skills that fit the theme:
- **Dragon Wine / Serpent Wine**: “drink” buffs that raise offense/defense in exchange for risk.
- **Fortified Dragon Wine**: strengthens the above effects (or reduces the drawback).
- **Burning Spark / Burning Explosion**: adds burn procs and payoff bursts.
- **Flame Mastery / Flaming Slash**: improves flame damage and adds flame-infused melee.
- **Hot Wind / Wildfire**: burn spreads faster; burning targets become hazards.

### Thunderfury Vajra (lightning)
Example normal skills that fit the theme:
- **Armor of Thunder**: lightning-themed mitigation or reactive shock.
- **Call Lightning**: periodic strikes or procs lightning under conditions.
- **Gathering Storm**: ramps lightning output during sustained combat.
- **Paralyze**: lightning hits apply a short control window.
- **Thunder of Doom / Golden Thunder**: big-payoff lightning effects after setup.

### Bitter River Bodhi (frost / freeze)
Example normal skills that fit the theme:
- **Cold Wind / Chilling Heart**: reliable slow/frost buildup.
- **Deep Freeze / Quick Freeze**: converts enough frost into a hard stop (freeze).
- **Deadly Chill**: boosts damage against chilled/frozen targets.
- **Ice Form**: defensive stance that leans into frost trading.
- **Arctic Blast / Blade of Glacier**: burst frost damage to start or finish freezes.

### Mother Trinity (bleed / poison)
Example normal skills that fit the theme:
- **Blood Plague / Blood Venom Worm**: turning bleeds into a spreading sickness.
- **Poisoned Blade**: attacks inflict poison alongside physical damage.
- **Toxic Corpse**: defeated enemies leave lingering poison hazards.
- **Vitality Extraction / Vampire**: sustain through harming poisoned/bleeding targets.
- **Judgment Day / Crazy Wish**: high-risk “curse” style payoff effects.

### Soul Blade Shura (blade-spirit conjuring)
Example normal skills that fit the theme:
- **Blade Spirit Talisman / Blade Spirit’s Will**: strengthens conjured blades and their uptime.
- **Guardian Spirit Blade**: summons blades that guard or retaliate.
- **Flawless Conjuration**: reduces friction (cooldowns/costs) so conjuring loops smoothly.
- **Mountain Crusher / Heaven Sundering Blade**: heavier strikes when spirits are fully online.
- **Spirit of Sacrifice**: trade HP or safety for a burst window.

### Underworld Vidyaraja (soul / suffering themes)
Example normal skills that fit the theme:
- **River of Blood / Sanguine Blade**: convert combat into “blood debt” style damage.
- **Soul Blast / Soul Diversion**: weaponize soul energy to burst or redirect harm.
- **Suffering of Pain / Suffering of Age**: scaling damage based on endured hardship.
- **Not Your Time**: a death-prevention style trigger with a cost.
- **Dark General’s Domain**: creates a hostile zone that empowers your kit.

### Wheels of Solar and Lunar (Normal_Skills_9)
The wiki’s Skills page includes a **Wheels of Solar and Lunar** section with anchors like **Starting_Skills_9** and **Normal_Skills_9**.

However, in the rendered tables I pulled via the API, **Normal_Skills_9 appears as a header without populated normal-skill entries**.
- The starting skills are shown by name only (e.g., “Opposing Extremes”, “Chaos”), with no descriptions visible in the table snapshot.

If you want, I can follow up by pulling the dedicated pages for those skill names (if they exist/aren’t redlinks) and then we can fill this subsection with real mechanics.
