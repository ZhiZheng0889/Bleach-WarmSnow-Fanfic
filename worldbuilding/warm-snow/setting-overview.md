# Setting overview (starter)

## Core pitch
*Warm Snow* is presented as a dark-fantasy world where an eerie phenomenon called “Warm Snow” looms over society. The story frame (as described on the wiki home page) follows **Bi-an**, a warrior on a crusade against the **Five Great Clans**, with the world on the brink of destruction.

## Tone anchors (useful for crossover)
- **Rot under splendor**: the setting emphasizes inequality and decay—those with power indulge while common people suffer.
- **Omens & strange occurrences**: unnatural events are treated as symptoms of systemic injustice and spiritual rot.
- **Blood-price solutions**: the setting’s language implies that restoring balance may require sacrifice.

## Practical writing guidance
- Treat “Warm Snow” as both **weather** and **curse/omen**: it should show up in sensory details (heat where cold should be) and in social behavior (fear, superstition, scapegoating).
- Keep the Five Great Clans as the big political pillars; smaller groups (sects, guards, cults) can orbit them.

## Open questions to pin down later
- What, specifically, is “Warm Snow” in-universe (origin, mechanics, spread)?
- Who/what are the Five Great Clans (names, domains, ideology)?
- What is Bi-an’s origin, oath, and constraints?
