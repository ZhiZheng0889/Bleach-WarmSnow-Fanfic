# Technology evolution: crossover arms race timeline

This page ties the two tech tracks together:
- Warm Snow-side craft/ritual engineering (clans/sects/Imperial Guard/Hellborne logistics)
- Soul Society-side institutional engineering (Kido doctrine, containment, confiscation, research)

Use it as a quick "what exists yet" sanity check when outlining arcs.

## Shared assumptions
- Progress is **lumpy**: one successful template, seal, or procedure can jump capability by a whole tier.
- The real currency is **repeatability**: the side that can do it twice can do it a hundred times.
- Most breakthroughs happen after **a failure in the field** that forces standardization.

## Act-by-act tech escalation (aligned to the crossover acts)
### Act I: Rukongai Breach
Warm Snow side
- Learns which relic traits survive confiscation; pivots to **quick-detach fittings** and disposable concealment layers.
- Refines "street-safe" elixirs that mask symptoms long enough to cross checkpoints.

Soul Society side
- Introduces first-pass **incident taxonomy** (Warm Snow vs hollow vs rogue experiment) and basic quarantine drills.
- Standardizes confiscation tags and temporary storage seals (good enough, not perfect).

Hybrid outcome
- The black market adopts Soul Society-style chain-of-custody tricks to create convincing decoy ledgers.

### Act II: Seireitei Outer Wall
Warm Snow side
- Xu and Bai iterate **suppressor fittings** and silence-style seal language (imperfect but disruptive).
- Yue perfects routing: moving contraband through gaps in patrol schedules rather than through brute stealth.

Soul Society side
- Detection improves: fewer false positives, better triage, faster cordons.
- Counter-seals appear that prevent easy syncing between unknown artifacts and local spiritual structures.

Hybrid outcome
- "Legalistic" cursework emerges: seals that trigger only when a document is signed, a gate is crossed, or a duty oath is taken.

### Act III: Dangai Chasms
Warm Snow side
- Develops stress-tests for time/pressure environments: relics that remain stable under distortion.
- Improves field repair: modular parts that can be swapped mid-mission.

Soul Society side
- Research units push for stricter access control and artifact tiers; enforcement becomes political.
- Portable containment kits improve so non-specialists can hold anomalies briefly.

Hybrid outcome
- Counter-countermeasures: artifacts that behave "normal" until placed inside standard containment, then change.

### Act IV: Hell Forges under Senzaikyu
Warm Snow side
- Furnace workflows become semi-repeatable: batches, quality tiers, and "acceptable failure" thresholds.
- Shen runs elixir lines that treat injury while planting long-tail consequences.

Soul Society side
- Formalizes dedicated teams for containment, forensics, and disposal.
- Raises the cost of smuggling by making seized items harder to recover intact.

Hybrid outcome
- Seal-etched metal becomes common: Xu steel that assumes it will be tagged, and is built to "fail safely" into predictable states.

### Act V: Royal Key Gambit
Warm Snow side
- Shifts from volume to **precision**: fewer artifacts, but tuned to counter specific captain doctrines.
- Operatives focus on recording and replication (templates over trophies).

Soul Society side
- Moves from reaction to preemption: predictive patrol patterns, proactive interdiction, controlled information release.

Hybrid outcome
- "Doctrine hacking" appears: tech that forces squads to fight like a different squad (misleading sensors, breaking formation habits).

## What each side is trying to steal
- Warm Snow wants: reusable seal grammars, containment templates, and movement infrastructure knowledge.
- Soul Society wants: forge repeatability methods, elixir stabilization, and smuggling route maps.

## Red flags (keep the arms race grounded)
- No side should get perfect counters instantly; each template introduces a **new failure mode**.
- The stronger the tool, the bigger the **social footprint** (paperwork, supply lines, missing people, clinic rumors).
