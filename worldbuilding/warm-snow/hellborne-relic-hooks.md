# Hellborne Relic Hooks (Unique vs Mimic)

Scene-ready hooks for Hellborne Unique relics and their mimic tiers, with acquisition/XP notes and failure quirks.

- **Blood Calyx (Unique)** / *Calyx Copies (legendary/epic mimics)*
  - Wants: self-bleed to armor-penetrate; rage stacking.
  - Acquisition: bound to Blade/Blood Path elites; stolen only if bearer is slain in ritual zone.
  - XP/perk: +rage on self-bleed, bonus armor pen; mimics leak trails captains can track.
  - Failure: mimics dry out, losing bleed conversion; trail gives away position.

- **Azure Filament Charm (Unique)** / *Filament Cutouts (epic/rare mimics)*
  - Wants: flying swords + lightning; ranged chaining.
  - Acquisition: Flying Swords/Thunder Paths; trade via Yue ferries.
  - XP/perk: lightning arcs between swords; mimics arc twice then burn out.
  - Failure: shorted by Seal Lanterns; arcs may jump to allies.

- **Furnace Heart Core (Unique)** / *Core Coals (legendary mimics)*
  - Wants: mid-fight rerolls of weapon stats; heat management.
  - Acquisition: Furnace Path leaders; won in forge arenas.
  - XP/perk: reroll one stat per encounter; mimics reroll once per day with shatter risk.
  - Failure: overheat and crack under Royal Guard Reiatsu; mimics explode if double-rerolled.

- **Chains of Return (Unique)** / *Recall Links (rare mimics)*
  - Wants: bind and yank targets through Hellmouth seams.
  - Acquisition: Chains Path; gained by sealing three captives.
  - XP/perk: pull through Bakudo; mimics only pull line-of-sight.
  - Failure: links snap against captain-class pressure; backlash drags user if resisted.

- **Talisman of False Moon (Unique)** / *Wax Moon Talismans (epic/rare mimics)*
  - Wants: perfect spiritual afterimage to spoof Zanpakuto spirits.
  - Acquisition: Paper Path; crafted after recording a Bankai silhouette.
  - XP/perk: 10-count perfect spoof; mimics flicker after two counts.
  - Failure: sensory captains can “hear” the wax stutter; melts under fire/heat.

- **Seal Lantern (Hellborne variant)**
  - Wants: reveal mimic signatures; double as lure triggers for Chains pulls.
  - Acquisition: stolen Guard tech modified by Paper/Chains Paths.
  - XP/perk: highlights suppressed relics; can bait captains into Hellmouth traps.
  - Failure: shorts to Thunderfury pulses; flags the holder to Kido scanners.

- **Counter-sigil (Hellborne fork)**
  - Wants: rewrite Bai/Kido seals to mask raids.
  - Acquisition: Paper Path + Bai defectors; learned via stolen archives.
  - XP/perk: temporary false archives; reuse risk backlash.
  - Failure: overheats and backfires, revealing true signatures.
