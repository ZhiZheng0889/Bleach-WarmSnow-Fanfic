# Relics / Elixirs (starter)

In the wiki’s framing, **Relics** (also called **Elixirs**) are **support items** you find during a run. Their effects can be strong and build-defining.

## Acquisition (where they come from)
Relics can appear from multiple run sources, including:
- Dedicated relic rooms
- Drops from elite enemies
- Shops
- Boss rewards
- Run start (with an upgrade that lets you begin with a stored relic)

## Usage (slot system)
You can hold **up to 4 relics** at once, one in each slot:
- **Core**
- **Power**
- **Agility**
- **Skill**

A key worldbuilding hook: **the same relic can behave differently depending on the slot** you equip it in.

## Refining (turning extra relics into power)
The wiki describes shop upgrades that let you **refine** unwanted relics to gain stat increases.
- Refining is tied to a shop upgrade path (described as “Remembrance – Forge” on the wiki).
- Another upgrade (“Master of Destiny”) lets you **choose which attribute** gets improved when refining.

## Using this in fic
- Treat relics as **pill-box elixirs**, **forbidden talismans**, or **sealed organs** that “seat” into a body’s four channels (Core/Power/Agility/Skill).
- Refining becomes an in-world ritual: breaking down a relic’s “fate” to strengthen the practitioner.

## Example relic names (for flavor lists)
The Relics page enumerates many items (including DLC lists). A few names you can reuse as props without locking in mechanics yet:
- White Tiger Spirit
- Black Tortoise Spirit
- Azure Dragon Spirit
- Vermilion Bird Spirit
- Zombie Finger
- Pearl
- Realgar
- Heart of Hatred

(Keep mechanics TBD unless you pull each relic’s dedicated page.)
