# Soul Blade Shura

Conjured blade spirits and additional flying swords (DLC2 sect).

- **Starter skills**: DLC statue; no fixed starter beyond acquisition.
- **Marquee skills**: Blade Spirit, Ten Thousand Swords.
- **Unlock**: defeat a DLC2 boss.
- **Hallmarks**: spectral sword familiars, multi-angle pressure, spirit blades that ignore some armor.
- **Gear tilt**: favors flying sword damage, spirit penetration, summon duration; synergizes with Azure Dragon relics.
- **Crossovers**: unnerves Zanpakuto spirits; Byakuya views it as Senbonzakura kin; Bai archivists covet their spirit-control methods.
