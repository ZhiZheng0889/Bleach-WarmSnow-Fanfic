# Infinite Arhat

Flying sword sect that pressures from range with hovering blades.

- **Starter skills**: Infinity (guaranteed), Sword Rain, Sun Piercer.
- **Marquee skills**: Sword Dance, Blade Cage.
- **Unlock**: first defeat of Sima Ying.
- **Hallmarks**: orbiting sword arrays, remote slashes from odd angles, meditative calm mid-fight.
- **Gear tilt**: favors flying sword damage, ranged boosts, lightning/frost hybrids for crowd control.
- **Crossovers**: loves Yue flight lanes and Tideway Tokens; clashes with Bai censors; Byakuya notes their orbiting blades echo Senbonzakura control. 
- **Duties (Gotei analog)**: Aerial/ranged overwatch; locks down corridors with sword fields, escorts convoys from above, disrupts enemy formations at range.
