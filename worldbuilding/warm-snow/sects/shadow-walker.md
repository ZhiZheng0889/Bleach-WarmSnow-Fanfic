# Shadow-Walker

Parry/block counter sect favoring opportunistic ripostes.

- **Starter skills**: purchased—no guaranteed starter beyond statue acquisition.
- **Marquee skills**: Shadow Guard, Reversal.
- **Unlock**: buy via Scarlet Treasure (Red Souls).
- **Hallmarks**: patience, short counter windows, shadow feints before a decisive strike.
- **Gear tilt**: favors block effectiveness, counter damage, stealth bonuses; Yue bribes can hide their movement.
- **Crossovers**: ideal river enforcers for Yue; strong vs Bai censors when silenced; Soi Fon respects their timing but hunts their smugglers.
