# Mother Trinity

Bleed/poison stacking sect built on “blood poison” cursework.

- **Starter skills**: Blood Poison (guaranteed), Blood Spatter, Infestation.
- **Marquee skills**: Crimson Sea, Parasite.
- **Unlock**: kill 9 Cursed Tomes.
- **Hallmarks**: arterial sprays weaponized, venom blooms, attrition that ramps while mobile.
- **Gear tilt**: favors bleed/poison relics, damage over time, life drain; Shen brews are a power source and a political liability.
- **Crossovers**: clashes with 4th Division healers; Urahara/Mayuri track their toxins; Hollow masks corrode under Crimson Sea.
- **Duties (Gotei analog)**: Attrition and sabotage; seed poison zones, soften enemy lines, drain stamina ahead of a main assault.
