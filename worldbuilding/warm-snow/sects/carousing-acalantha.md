# Carousing Acalantha

Flame and intoxication sect mixing burning with liquor-themed combat.

- **Starter skills**: Burning Blade (guaranteed), Wine Soaked, Drunken Song.
- **Marquee skills**: Incinerate, Demon Wine.
- **Unlock**: first defeat of Lu Kunhai.
- **Hallmarks**: swaying footwork, fiery breath clouds, enemies set ablaze while the user "toasts" mid-combo.
- **Gear tilt**: favors burn damage, intoxication synergies, rage gain from drinking; Shen tonics and Acalantha brews overlap.
- **Crossovers**: pairs well with Carousing relics; may run smuggling with Yue; volatile in Seireitei—flammable in tight alleys.
