Frost/freeze lockdown sect with shatter payoffs.

- **Starter skills**: Icy Cold (guaranteed), Bone Chill, White Frost.
- **Marquee skills**: Frost Arm, Frost Army.
- **Unlock**: first defeat of Zhao Changgeng.
- **Hallmarks**: ice mist veils, slowed arenas, pressure spikes when foes are frozen in place.
- **Gear tilt**: favors frost damage, freeze duration, control into burst; combines with Black Tortoise relics.
- **Crossovers**: allies with Bai archivists guarding frozen archives; counters Acalantha flames; in Seireitei, can mirror Hinamori/Hitsugaya control tactics.
- **Duties (Gotei analog)**: Control/containment; build ice walls, slow advances, hold chokepoints, set up shatter combos for allied vanguards.
