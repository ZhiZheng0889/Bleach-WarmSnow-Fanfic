# Weapons: Excaliburs (starter)

In the wiki’s terminology, “Excaliburs” are **weapons** you pick up during a run. Mechanically they combine:
- **Stat boosts** (scaling with rarity)
- A **weapon-specific effect** that becomes active only when certain conditions are met

This page paraphrases the wiki’s system description; it does not attempt to list every individual weapon yet.

## Where weapons come from
Weapons can show up in multiple places during a run, including:
- Dedicated weapon rooms ("Excalibur rooms")
- Shops and merchants between areas
- As drops/rewards from elite fights and bosses

## Rarity and how many stat lines you get
Weapons come in four rarities, and rarity controls how many attribute lines you roll:
- Rare: 1 attribute boost
- Epic: 2 attribute boosts
- Legendary: 3 attribute boosts
- Mythic: 4 attribute boosts

Rarity can also be upgraded through specific NPC services (the wiki calls out a blacksmith upgrade path and a named character who can also upgrade rarity).

## Attribute boosts (what can roll)
Each weapon rolls one or more **attribute boosts** depending on rarity. The wiki’s examples include:
- **All damage** increase
- **Armor penetration**
- **Movement speed**
- **Sheath cooldown** reduction
- **Melee damage** and **melee attack speed**
- **Ranged damage**
- **Rage gain**
- **Legendary relic drop chance**
- **Blue Souls** drop quantity
- **Elemental damage** bonuses (flame / frost / poison / lightning)
- **Status synergy**: extra damage to enemies suffering burning / freeze / poison / bleed / stun / drunk

Some rolls are explicitly described as **higher-rarity-only procs**, such as:
- A chance for attacks to deal **multiple times** their normal damage (e.g., double/triple/quadruple)
- A chance for attacks to temporarily make the enemy take **more damage** for a short window

## Weapon-specific effect (“Excalibur Effect”)
Each weapon also carries a unique effect that typically **requires** you to hold specific items or satisfy a condition. Mythic rarity further amplifies that unique effect.

## Distilling (turning weapons into souls)
Weapons can be converted into a currency referred to as **Blue Souls**, with the payout scaling by rarity. The wiki gives these distill values:
- Rare: 50 Blue Souls
- Epic: 100 Blue Souls
- Legendary: 200 Blue Souls
- Mythic: 400 Blue Souls

## Example named Excaliburs (for fic flavor)
The wiki lists many individual weapons, each with a conditional unique effect. A few examples you can treat as “named blades” in prose:
- **Annihilation**: ties into a “cold blood/recall” style loop; mythic-tier payoff rewards dealing damage while a key technique is on cooldown.
- **Archeron**: on a frost-related trigger, can create a lingering frost zone that treats enemies as frozen; mythic makes the zone stronger and expanding.
- **Avalanche**: when combined with specific relics, melee hits can trigger a forward impact “avalanche”; mythic repeats the surge.
- **Azure Dragon**: with a matching spirit relic, flying-sword hits can fire a lightning bolt along a path; mythic adds a separate large flying-sword attack bonus under another condition.
- **Black Tortoise**: with a matching spirit relic, grants sturdiness and retaliatory stomps when hit; mythic adds additional defense under a separate condition.

(If you want a complete weapon-by-weapon catalog for plotting, we can add a separate appendix page that lists names + required items + one-line paraphrased effects.)
