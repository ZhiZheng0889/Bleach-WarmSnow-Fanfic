# Weapons: Excaliburs (starter)

In the wiki’s terminology, “Excaliburs” are **weapons** you pick up during a run. Mechanically they combine:
- **Stat boosts** (scaling with rarity)
- A **weapon-specific effect** that becomes active only when certain conditions are met

This page paraphrases the wiki’s system description; it does not attempt to list every individual weapon yet.

## Where weapons come from
Weapons can show up in multiple places during a run, including:
- Dedicated weapon rooms ("Excalibur rooms")
- Shops and merchants between areas
- As drops/rewards from elite fights and bosses

## Rarity and how many stat lines you get
Weapons come in four rarities, and rarity controls how many attribute lines you roll:
- Rare: 1 attribute boost
- Epic: 2 attribute boosts
- Legendary: 3 attribute boosts
- Mythic: 4 attribute boosts

Rarity can also be upgraded through specific NPC services (e.g., a blacksmith-type upgrade path).

## Common attribute boost families (examples)
The wiki lists many possible rolls; in prose terms, they mainly fall into:
- **General offense**: overall damage, crit, armor penetration
- **Defense/sustain**: damage reduction, healing, max HP
- **Elemental focus**: boosts to flame/frost/poison/lightning damage
- **Status synergy**: extra damage against targets suffering burning/freeze/poison/bleed/stun/drunk
- **Speed/tempo**: movement speed, melee speed, cooldown reduction
- **Loot/economy**: improved relic drop chance and soul gains

Some higher-rarity-only rolls include “proc”-style effects (chance to spike damage or temporarily increase enemy damage taken).

## Weapon-specific effect (“Excalibur Effect”)
Each weapon also carries a unique effect that typically **requires** you to hold specific items or satisfy a condition. Mythic rarity further amplifies that unique effect.

## Distilling (turning weapons into souls)
Weapons can be converted into a currency referred to as **Blue Souls**, with the payout scaling by rarity.
