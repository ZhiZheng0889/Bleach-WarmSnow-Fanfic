# Chapter 3 — Time Makes Institutions

## Scene 1

- **POV**: Split montage
- **Location**: White Court / Black Commune
- **Goal**: Show how systems age differently

Time did what it always did.

It took the first good intentions and asked them to survive being repeated.

### I. The First Hundred Years (when everything is still personal)

On the white side, people still believed the court was a room.

They could name the clerk who wrote their grievance.

They could name the guard who walked them out.

They could point to the Spirit King and say: *he listened.*

The houses were young enough to be embarrassed by luxury.

Their coats were plain.

Their servants were cousins.

When a noble lied, it felt like an accident.

The Spirit King watched futures and chose the least blood today.

It worked.

Most days.

On the black side, the commune was still small enough that the ledger looked like a family record.

A name.

A task.

A portion.

A handprint in soot.

The First Smith did not need to threaten anyone.

If someone tried to hide food, there were too many eyes.

If someone tried to claim a title, there were too many laughs.

Their rules were not holy.

They were practical.

And practicality, when shared, looked a lot like mercy.

### II. The First Thousand Years (when repetition becomes tradition)

On the white side, the court stopped being a room.

It became a calendar.

A procession.

A script.

Disputes were no longer argued for truth; they were argued for performance.

The houses learned the first real trick of hierarchy:

If you control the schedule, you control the outcome.

A petition delayed became a petition denied.

A hearing moved to winter became a hearing without farmers.

The Spirit King saw this.

He could see the rot forming like hairline cracks in a blade.

And still he chose the least blood today.

Because to cut down a house now would cause a war.

Because to cut down a house later would cause an older war.

Because future-sight was a cruel kind of arithmetic.

So he rebalanced.

He wrote new rules.

He appointed new officials.

He created new layers between the crown and the hungry.

Every layer made the realm more stable.

Every layer also made it easier for stability to become an excuse.

On the black side, the commune spread.

Not by conquest.

By imitation.

A forge-hall here.

A shared storehouse there.

A Path guild teaching apprentices how to make a blade that did not belong to one family.

As the commune grew, the First Smith did what the Spirit King would have called harsh.

He instituted rotations.

Not just for labor.

For authority.

Guild-leaders stepped down.

Quartermasters changed hands.

Ledgers were audited by people who disliked each other on principle.

The First Smith built distrust into the machine, because he had learned the oldest truth of disaster:

Trust is precious.

Which means it is also a resource.

Which means someone will try to hoard it.

### III. The First Ten Thousand Years (when systems begin to pretend they are natural)

On the white side, a child was born into a house and told, before he could read, that his blood meant something.

That was the real beginning.

Not the wall.

Not the court.

Not the first judgment.

A lullaby that sounded like destiny.

The court produced nobles who had never been hungry.

They did not think they were cruel.

They thought hunger was a myth commoners told each other to feel important.

A magistrate once asked, genuinely curious, why the poor could not simply eat less.

The Spirit King heard about it.

He felt something hot in his chest.

For a moment, he wanted to be the kind of king the First Smith feared.

Then he saw the futures.

If he punished the magistrate publicly, the houses would call it tyranny.

If he punished him privately, the houses would call it weakness.

If he did nothing, the poor would call it abandonment.

So he chose the least blood today.

He created a relief office.

He funded soup.

He wrote a law that sounded like compassion.

The nobles praised his wisdom.

They also learned a lesson:

When suffering becomes an office, it becomes budget.

When it becomes budget, it becomes bargaining.

When it becomes bargaining, it becomes politics.

And politics was a blade you could wield without ever dirtying your hands.

On the black side, the commune held.

Not perfectly.

People still cheated.

People still lied.

People still tried, sometimes, to make a Path into a family name.

But they found it difficult to build a throne in a room where every chair was communal.

If someone spoke like a lord, someone else asked them to pick up a hammer.

If they refused, they were not exiled.

They were laughed out of relevance.

That, too, was a kind of violence.

But it was the kind that left bodies alive.

The First Smith watched it all without prophecy.

He watched the same way he watched metal cool.

By understanding what it wanted to become.

### IV. The First Hundred Thousand Years (when the founders become myths)

On the white side, the Spirit King became a symbol.

Symbols were easier to worship than people.

They were also easier to use.

The houses began to speak his name the way priests speak a god’s name—always with reverence, always with a hidden agenda.

They claimed they served him.

They also claimed that anyone who challenged them challenged the realm.

This was the final trick.

To make the ladder feel like the sky.

The Spirit King could see it.

He could see the precise moment when he stopped being a person and became a justification.

And, impossibly, he could see futures where even that was still better than the alternative.

So he remained.

Naive, the First Smith would have called him.

Hopeful, the Spirit King would have called himself.

On the black side, the First Smith’s commune also became myth.

But their myths were not about blood.

They were about famine.

They were about winter.

They were about the Warm Snow that killed a world and taught survivors how to share a bowl.

Their founder became a cautionary story.

Not a saint.

A reminder:

If you build a system that assumes people are angels, demons will inherit it.

So the commune kept its ugly safeguards.

Ledgers.

Rotations.

Struts instead of walls.

And a culture that treated secrecy the way a forge treated rust.

A small crack that would ruin everything if you ignored it.

### V. The Seam (where friendship becomes destiny)

Across ages, across systems, the seam remained.

Warm snow still fell there.

On one side, a court polished itself until it could no longer see its own stains.

On the other, a commune kept dirt under its nails and called that honesty.

The Spirit King would not stop building.

He would keep choosing the least blood today.

The First Smith would not stop predicting.

He would keep reading hunger like a map.

Somewhere in the distance of time—close enough to feel, far enough to pretend it was avoidable—their friendship waited for its next name.

Nemesis.

## Notes
- Structure: Prose montage with escalating time scales (century → millennia).
- Arc: Court corruption institutionalizes slowly; commune remains “better” for a long time because its safeguards are designed for human weakness.
