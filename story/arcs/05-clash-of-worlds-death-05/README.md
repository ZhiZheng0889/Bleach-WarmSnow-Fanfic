# Death Stage 05 — Clash Between Worlds (Arc Guide)

This stage bridges from the prior fallout into the next escalation.

## Core Throughline

- The seam becomes an object of **doctrine**: Soul Society hunts rules, precedents, and classifications.
- The seam also becomes an object of **religion**: icons and “worthiness” myths try to turn access into obedience.
- Ren answers with **practice**: auditable services (lists/depots) over saints and tools.

## Key Terms (quick reference)

- **Doctrine capture (Soul Society)**: converting anomaly into policy by naming, categorizing, and omitting inconvenient warnings.
- **Icon economy**: lanterns/rituals/tithes used to sell certainty and justify control.
- **Key (classification)**: dehumanizing term for a person who can trigger anomalies; used to justify turning a person into a gate.
