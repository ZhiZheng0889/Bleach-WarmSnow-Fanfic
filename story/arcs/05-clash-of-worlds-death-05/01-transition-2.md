# Chapter — Saints and Tools (Death Stage 05)

## Scene 1

- **POV**: A street preacher (civilian)
- **Location**: A market corner
- **Goal**: Turn fear into devotion; devotion into control

The preacher raised a lantern and declared it proof.

“The bridge has come,” he shouted.

People gathered because gathering felt like safety.

He spoke of a door that only the worthy could open.

He spoke of a tithe.

He spoke of obedience.

Ren heard the speech from the far edge of the crowd and felt sick.

Not because the preacher lied.

Because the preacher was inventing a structure.

Structures persisted.

The lantern was ordinary.

Glass scuffed.

Metal dented.

Oil that smelled like every other oil.

But held up in the preacher’s hand, it became an icon.

That was the trick.

Icons were cheaper than food.

Icons could be carried.

Icons could be sold.

The preacher’s voice rose.

“The bridge has come,” he shouted, “because we have been tested!”

Someone in the crowd shouted back, “Tested by who?”

The preacher smiled.

“By the world,” he said.

The crowd murmured.

The world was a useful villain.

You couldn’t arrest it.

You couldn’t argue with it.

You could only obey.

The preacher continued.

“A door that only the worthy can open,” he said. “A passage that chooses the faithful.”

Ren heard the line and felt his stomach twist.

Choose.

That was the word everyone loved.

It turned mechanics into morality.

It turned accidents into judgment.

It turned suffering into proof.

The preacher’s hand dipped toward a basket beside his feet.

Coins clinked inside.

“A tithe,” the preacher said softly now, as if revealing a secret. “Not for me. For the work. For the protection of the bridge.”

People nodded.

Some because they believed.

Some because they were afraid not to.

Some because giving money felt like buying certainty.

Ren’s jaw clenched.

The enemy was not only captains and nobles.

The enemy was the human desire to outsource responsibility.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: Behind the market stalls
- **Goal**: Decide whether to break the myth publicly

Ren could step into the crowd and contradict the preacher.

He could do it in one sentence.

“I’m not holy.”

But he knew how crowds worked.

They would hear the denial and keep the legend.

They would turn his refusal into proof of humility.

Ren looked at the lantern.

At the people.

At the hands that reached for meaning.

He realized then: the enemy was not only captains and nobles.

The enemy was the human desire to outsource responsibility.

Ren exhaled and walked away.

Not retreat.

Strategy.

He would break the myth by building something better than a myth: a practice.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: A quiet side street after the market
- **Goal**: Put the first pieces of “practice” in motion

Ren walked until the market noise dulled.

He found a narrow street where two women were arguing over a sack of grain.

Not screaming.

Bargaining.

Ren watched them for a moment.

This was the real world.

Not sermons.

Not stages.

Not basins.

Hands.

Food.

Who got it.

Ren stepped closer.

“How many are you feeding?” he asked.

Both women turned, startled.

One narrowed her eyes.

“Who are you?” she demanded.

Ren held his hands open.

“Someone who’s tired of myths,” he said.

The other woman—older, hair streaked gray—snorted.

“Myths keep people calm,” she said.

Ren nodded.

“And calm keeps them obedient,” he replied.

The gray-haired woman stared at him.

For a heartbeat, Ren thought she would tell him to leave.

Instead she asked, “Do you have grain?”

Ren shook his head.

“No,” he said. “I have a way to move without checkpoints. Sometimes.”

He hated even saying it.

It felt like lighting a signal fire.

But practice needed a beginning.

The younger woman’s eyes widened.

“You mean the bridge,” she whispered.

Ren’s stomach tightened.

He did not confirm.

He did not deny.

He asked a different question.

“Do you know who’s keeping lists?” he said.

The older woman frowned.

“The depot,” she said. “Some clerk. Some council.”

Ren nodded.

Lists.

Not icons.

Not sermons.

Lists could be audited.

Lists could be shared.

Lists could be refused.

“Good,” Ren said. “Take your grain from the depot. Tell them you’re feeding seven.”

The younger woman blinked.

“Why would they listen?”

Ren looked back toward the market.

He imagined the preacher’s lantern.

Then he imagined something else.

People refusing to pay a tithe for access.

People demanding access as a right.

“Because if enough people show up with the same need,” Ren said, “the depot will have to decide whether it’s a gate or a service.”

He paused.

“And we’ll learn who it really is.”

## Notes

## Notes

- Continuity: Introduces social/religious capture of the seam narrative.
- Foreshadowing: Ren’s “practice” approach becomes key to resisting institutional myth-making.
