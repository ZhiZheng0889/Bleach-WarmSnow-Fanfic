# Chapter — The Hunt for a Rule (Death Stage 05)

## Characters

- **Introduced / First appearance**:
- **Returning**:
- **Changes (status / power / gear / role)**:
- **Relationships / allegiances**:

## Scene 1

- **POV**: A Soul Society investigator (TBD)
- **Location**: A sealed archive room
- **Goal**: Find precedent; turn anomaly into doctrine

The investigator did not fear the unknown.

He feared the unknown staying unknown.

If the seam could not be named, it could not be commanded.

He opened scrolls that smelled like old incense and old blood.

He found stories.

Then footnotes.

Then margins.

One margin note, written as if someone had been ashamed:

“There are passages that answer to people, not to gates.”

The investigator copied it.

Not because it was true.

Because it could become policy.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: The investigator
- **Location**: The archive’s inner shelves
- **Goal**: Prove the anomaly can be standardized; decide what to omit

The archive room was built like an accusation.

Stone so thick it swallowed echoes.

A door with three locks, each opened by a different hand so no one could pretend responsibility was singular.

The investigator liked the design.

It admitted that power was safest when it was distributed.

It also admitted that power was still power.

He carried a small oil lamp that made the air smell like tallow.

The shelves were stacked with scrolls and tablets, cataloged by calamity.

Plague years.

War years.

The years when souls went missing.

He found a section marked with an old character that meant threshold.

He unrolled a scroll and read.

It was not doctrine.

It was a confession.

“Passages formed where grief gathered,” it said. “Passages answered to the living in the moment they stopped believing in gates.”

The investigator’s jaw tightened.

That sentence could not go into a report.

If passages answered to disbelief, then an institution was the wrong tool.

If passages answered to living intention, then control would require something messy.

Consent.

Trust.

The investigator did not hate those words.

He hated their unpredictability.

He wrote a cleaner note on his paper.

“Passage activation conditions unknown. Requires further study.”

He kept reading.

In the margins he found variations.

Some notes were written with awe.

Some with anger.

One, written in a cramped hand as if afraid of being seen:

“Do not make a gate out of a person. The cost will be paid in bodies.”

The investigator paused.

He copied the warning.

Then, after a beat, he drew a line through it.

Not because it was false.

Because it was inconvenient.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: A crowded ferry crossing
- **Goal**: Stay anonymous while the rumor of him spreads

Rumor traveled faster than bodies.

By the time Ren reached the ferry, people were already telling his story wrong.

They said he was a saint.

They said he was a weapon.

They said he was an omen of war.

Ren stood in line and tried to look like nobody.

Nobody, unfortunately, did not have a corridor inside their chest.

The seam pressed against him.

The ferry bell rang.

For a heartbeat, the water looked too deep.

As if it could be another door.

Ren kept his eyes on the water.

The river was wide here, dark and restless.

It carried branches, broken planks, the occasional dead fish.

It carried the city’s waste without complaint.

Ren understood why people stared at it and imagined salvation.

People always wanted a current to carry them away from consequences.

The ferry’s rope creaked.

The ferryman—an older man with a scar down his cheek—watched the line like he was counting threats.

“No weapons drawn,” the ferryman barked. “No fighting on my boat. You want to die, do it on your own shore.”

Someone laughed.

Someone didn’t.

Ren stepped forward with the line.

He tried to hold his face neutral.

Not blank.

Blank drew attention.

Neutral let you pass.

The seam inside him pressed again.

Not opening.

Testing.

Ren felt the thinness in the air above the water—subtle, like the world was a cloth that could be pulled.

He clenched his jaw.

He forced his thoughts away from doors.

He thought about bread.

About counting.

About the smell of antiseptic in the clinic.

The thinness eased.

The ferryman’s eyes landed on Ren.

For a moment, Ren thought he had been recognized.

But the ferryman’s gaze moved on.

Ren exhaled.

He stepped onto the ferry.

The wood under his boots was damp.

The river rocked the boat.

The world, for a heartbeat, felt too open.

Ren gripped the railing.

If the seam decided rivers were doors, then he would never feel safe near water again.

## Notes

## Notes

- Continuity: Sets up Stage 05 as “investigation vs anonymity,” doctrine vs personhood.
- Foreshadowing: Institutional attempts to formalize the seam will escalate conflict.
