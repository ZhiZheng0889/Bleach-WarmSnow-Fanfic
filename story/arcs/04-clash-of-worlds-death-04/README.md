# Death Stage 04 — Clash Between Worlds (Arc Guide)

This stage bridges from the prior fallout into the next escalation.

## Core Throughline

- The revolution survives or dies on **administration**: lists, depots, routes, clinics, and who controls the stamp.
- “Order” mutates: courts fall, but **paper walls** can replace stone centers.
- The seam escalates: it seeks **routine** and **necessity**, not just tolls.

## Key Terms (quick reference)

- **Paper walls**: permits, seals, and forms that become soft thrones; control disguised as organization.
- **Refusal design (Hellborne ethos)**: rotation + transparency + the built-in ability to say “no” to anyone trying to become a center.
- **Seam necessity**: the corridor’s pressure to become inevitable through repeated use (structure/routine).
