## Scene 1

- **POV**: A council organizer (civilian)
- **Location**: A supply depot
- **Goal**: Keep food moving while factions fight over credit

Order looked like lists.

Crates counted.

Routes assigned.

Guards posted.

And a line of hungry people that did not move in the way lines were supposed to.

The organizer stood at a table made from two barrels and a plank.

He had not asked to become the person who decided how many mouths were “reasonable.”

He had simply been the one with the neatest handwriting.

That was how authority was born now.

Not from crowns.

From competence.

From exhaustion.

From the fact that someone had to do it.

He tried to keep his voice calm.

“Rice first,” he called. “Then bandages. Then lamp oil. If you need water, go to the back—no, not the back, the side. There’s a bucket. Share.”

People grumbled.

People obeyed.

Obedience did not mean trust.

It meant hunger.

The depot smelled like grain dust and sweat and fear.

Men moved crates with shoulders bowed.

Women tied sacks and argued quietly about who was lying.

A child sat on a crate and tried not to look at the food.

The organizer wrote.

Crate: rice.

Crate: beans.

Crate: salt.

He ticked the numbers.

Then he heard the first faction arrive.

Not by sound.

By the way the air changed.

One of them—clean clothes, clean hands—smiled like the smile was a credential.

“We’re here to help,” the clean-handed man said.

The organizer did not look up.

“Then carry,” he replied.

The man’s smile held.

“We can offer oversight,” he said. “A seal. To ensure legitimacy.”

The organizer finally looked up.

He saw the stamp in the man’s hand.

Red wax.

Pretty.

He saw the trap.

If the seal went on the crates, the seal would become the reason people ate.

And then the seal-holder would decide who deserved food.

Before the organizer could answer, the second faction pushed in.

They looked ragged, angry, righteous.

“No seals,” one of them snapped. “Seals are the court. Burn the stamp.”

The clean-handed man’s smile thinned.

“Without accountability, you invite theft,” he said.

The ragged faction leader stepped closer.

“Accountability is what you call control,” she said.

They began arguing over the table.

Over the organizer’s list.

Over the organizer’s existence.

Neither asked the hungry what they needed.

The organizer’s jaw tightened.

He discovered a cruel truth: doing the work made you visible.

Being visible made you claimable.

He put his pen down.

Hard.

The sound was sharp enough to cut through both speeches.

“If you want to argue,” he said, “do it while carrying.”

Both factions blinked.

The ragged leader scoffed.

The clean-handed man bristled.

The organizer pointed at the crates.

“Those sacks don’t move themselves,” he said. “And if they don’t move, people don’t eat. That’s the only legitimacy here.”

The line of hungry people watched.

For a moment, the factions hesitated.

Then someone in the line—an older woman with a bandage around her wrist—spoke.

“Carry,” she said.

Another voice joined.

“Carry.”

Then a third.

“If you’re here, carry.”

The organizer felt something loosen in his chest.

Not hope.

Something more practical.

Leverage.

The factions moved to the crates.

Grudgingly.

But they moved.

The organizer picked up his pen.

He wrote a new list.

Not of crates.

Of names.

Who carried.

Who argued.

Who stole.

Who lied.

And who, when offered a stamp, had refused it.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: The depot roof, night
- **Goal**: Understand the seam’s next demand

Night made the city honest.

In daylight, ruins could be called “reconstruction.”

At night, the gaps between buildings became visible.

The places where people disappeared.

Ren sat on the depot roof with his knees drawn up.

Below him, the depot quieted in waves.

Workers finished their last hauling.

The hungry went home with small bundles.

Guards—volunteers, mostly—took up positions that looked brave until you realized how tired they were.

Ren stared at the sky.

He felt the corridor press against it.

As if the world wanted to fold.

As if the door he made was not enough.

He touched the air.

It did not open.

But it answered.

Not with a passage.

With a sensation.

Like a toll.

Like a hand held out.

Ren’s mouth went dry.

He whispered, “What do you want?”

The seam did not speak.

It did not need to.

It reminded him.

Every bridge had supports.

Supports could be cut.

Ren thought of the depot.

Of lists.

Of seals.

Of the way a stamp could decide who ate.

He understood with a cold clarity that the seam was not only asking for blood or pain.

It was asking for structure.

For repetition.

For routine.

For a way to become inevitable.

Ren lowered his hand.

He stared into the dark.

“No center,” he whispered.

The air tightened.

Not open.

But offended.

Ren swallowed.

He realized then that the seam could be argued with.

And that arguing would have consequences.

## Notes

- Continuity: Shows order as contested labor and previews the seam escalating demands.
- Foreshadowing: The seam’s toll becomes explicit and political; it will try to make itself “necessary.”
