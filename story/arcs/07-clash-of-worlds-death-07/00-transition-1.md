# Chapter — Terms and Conditions (Death Stage 07)

## Scene 1

- **POV**: A negotiator (TBD)
- **Location**: A neutral meeting house
- **Goal**: Draft a treaty about the door without admitting who controls it

The negotiator placed three cups of tea on the table.

Three factions.

Three silences.

He spoke carefully.

“We need terms,” he said.

Someone replied, “We need control.”

Someone else replied, “We need to make sure control looks fair.”

The negotiator wrote words like “access,” “security,” “oversight.”

Words that sounded reasonable.

Words that, once signed, would become chains.

He thought of the seamwalker—whoever he was.

He wondered if the seamwalker knew that treaties were just doors made of paper.

The meeting house was deliberately plain.

No banners.

No statues.

No basin.

Neutrality performed through lack of decoration.

It was a lie everyone agreed to, because shared lies were how negotiations began.

The negotiator sat with his back to the wall and his hands on the table.

Not folded.

Folded hands looked like confidence.

He did not feel confident.

He felt like a man asked to tie a knot around smoke.

One faction represented “order.”

They used careful words.

They kept their voices low.

They spoke as if the world itself were a document that needed stamping.

One faction represented “the people.”

They used loud words.

They spoke in slogans and demands, as if volume could replace infrastructure.

The third faction was the most dangerous.

They represented survival.

They didn’t argue about ideals.

They argued about routes.

About food.

About who had been burned alive in a cart last week.

The negotiator wrote words like access, security, oversight.

Each word looked harmless on paper.

Each word could become a collar.

He had learned long ago that the first draft of a treaty was not a solution.

It was a claim.

One side would pretend the paper was neutral.

Then they would use it like a blade.

“We need terms,” the negotiator said.

Someone replied, “We need control.”

Someone else replied, “We need to make sure control looks fair.”

The negotiator’s pen paused.

He wrote anyway.

Control.

Fairness.

Oversight.

He did not write the real word.

Ownership.

Because saying ownership out loud would make the room honest.

And honesty was the fastest way to end a meeting without ending a conflict.

He thought of the seamwalker—whoever he was.

He wondered if the seamwalker knew that treaties were just doors made of paper.

And paper doors were easier to force than real ones.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: Outside the meeting house
- **Goal**: Refuse a treaty that turns him into a resource

Ren did not enter.

He listened.

He heard his life being converted into clauses.

He heard compassion being converted into quotas.

He heard fear being converted into security.

When the negotiator finally emerged, Ren spoke first.

“No,” Ren said.

The negotiator blinked.

“You haven’t even heard the offer,” he said.

Ren met his eyes.

“I heard the shape of it,” Ren replied.

Ren stood outside the meeting house with his shoulders loose and his weight evenly balanced.

If someone tried to grab him, he wanted to know which direction they chose.

Inside, the voices were muffled.

He caught phrases.

“Shared oversight.”

“Emergency powers.”

“Limited access.”

The corridor inside him tightened at the word limited.

He had learned that limitation was the language of ownership.

If someone could limit a thing, they could claim it.

If someone could claim it, they could sell it.

The door did not belong to anyone.

That was the only reason it still felt like mercy.

The negotiator finally emerged.

He looked like a man who had been holding a smile in place with muscle alone.

He blinked when he saw Ren.

Then he looked past Ren—quickly, instinctively—as if expecting guards.

“You haven’t even heard the offer,” he said.

Ren met his eyes.

“I heard the shape of it,” Ren said.

The negotiator exhaled.

“Then you know we’re trying to keep people from killing each other over you,” he said.

Ren’s mouth tightened.

“Over what they think I am,” Ren corrected.

The negotiator’s gaze dropped to Ren’s hands.

“You can make a door,” he said.

It was not a question.

Ren felt the seam inside him flinch.

He did not deny.

He did not confirm.

He said, “I can refuse.”

The negotiator’s eyes narrowed.

“Refusal isn’t a plan,” he said.

Ren’s voice stayed calm.

“Refusal is the first plan,” he replied. “It tells you what you’re not allowed to do to people.”

For a moment, the negotiator looked genuinely tired.

“Then what do you want?” he asked.

Ren glanced at the meeting house.

He imagined signatures.

Seals.

Quotas.

He imagined a “committee” that decided which bodies could cross.

He imagined a new basin.

“I want you to stop writing me into chains,” Ren said.

The negotiator swallowed.

“And if we don’t?”

Ren looked back at him.

“Then you’ll turn the door into a war,” Ren said. “And the corridor will learn what war tastes like.”

## Notes

- Continuity: Sets Stage 07 as diplomacy/legal capture attempts.
- Foreshadowing: Ren’s refusal forces factions toward coercion or sabotage.
