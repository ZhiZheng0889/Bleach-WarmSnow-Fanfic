## Scene 1

- **POV**: A saboteur (TBD)
- **Location**: A supply route
- **Goal**: Make “decentralized aid” look like chaos

The saboteur did not hate the hungry.

He hated the idea that the hungry could organize without permission.

So he burned one cart.

Only one.

Enough to start a rumor.

Enough to make people say, “See? This is why we need a center.”

He watched the smoke rise and felt satisfied.

Then he saw children run toward the fire.

Not to worship it.

To save what they could.

The saboteur’s satisfaction faltered.

Not because he regretted.

Because the world refused to become his clean lesson.

He had chosen the cart carefully.

Not the biggest.

Not the smallest.

Not one guarded by people who would fight back hard enough to make martyrs.

He chose one guarded by tired volunteers.

Tired volunteers made mistakes.

Mistakes made narratives.

He waited until the road bent and the trees made a tunnel.

He waited until the cart’s wheels hit a soft patch and slowed.

Then he tossed the oil.

It was not dramatic.

No explosion.

Just a wet slap against wood.

Then a small, cruel flame.

Fire spread the way rumors did.

It found edges.

It found cracks.

It fed on the places that were already weak.

The saboteur stepped back and watched.

He told himself he was preventing chaos.

He told himself he was teaching a lesson.

He told himself that if decentralized aid failed, people would beg for a center again.

Begging was leverage.

Then he saw children run toward the fire.

Not to worship it.

To save what they could.

They grabbed sacks.

They dragged them onto the dirt.

They cried and still moved.

The saboteur’s satisfaction faltered.

Not because he regretted.

Because the world refused to become his clean lesson.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: The burned cart
- **Goal**: Choose response: revenge (predictable) or repair (disruptive)

Ren arrived too late.

That was how it always started.

He stood in the ash and felt the corridor inside him tighten like a fist.

The seam wanted a simple answer.

Open a door.

Take someone.

Make a threat.

Ren did something else.

He started rebuilding.

Not alone.

He asked the children to help.

He asked the adults to bring water.

He turned the sabotage into a demonstration.

Not of strength.

Of resilience.

Ren knelt in the ash.

He picked up a half-burned sack.

Grain spilled through a hole like sand through fingers.

He felt rage flare—hot, simple.

The seam inside him responded to rage like a wound responding to pressure.

Open.

Take.

Make it end.

Ren forced the feeling down.

He looked at the children.

They were coughing, eyes red.

One boy held a sack almost his size and refused to drop it.

Ren stood.

“Water,” he called.

Adults looked up, startled.

“Buckets,” Ren said. “Now.”

Someone hesitated.

Ren’s voice sharpened.

“If you can argue, you can carry,” he said.

That line—borrowed from the depot organizer—hit the air like a slap.

People moved.

Not because Ren was holy.

Because Ren sounded like work.

Work was familiar.

Holiness was not.

He turned to the children.

“You,” he said, pointing. “Pull sacks away from the wheels. Don’t breathe the smoke. Wrap cloth around your mouth.”

The children stared.

Then obeyed.

Ren felt something shift.

Practice.

This was what he meant.

Not a myth.

A method.

As water hit flame, Ren glanced at the road.

He wondered if the saboteur was still watching.

If so, Ren wanted him to see this.

Not vengeance.

Refusal.

Repair.

Because sabotage wanted a predictable response.

Punishment.

Fear.

Ren would offer something else.

He would offer competence.

Competence was harder to undermine.

## Notes

## Notes

- Continuity: Escalates conflict into sabotage and narrative warfare.
- Foreshadowing: Repair-as-resistance becomes a strategic motif.
