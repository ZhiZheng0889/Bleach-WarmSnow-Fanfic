# Death Stage 07 — Clash Between Worlds (Arc Guide)

This stage bridges from the prior fallout into the next escalation.

## Core Throughline

- The corridor becomes a subject of **law**: treaties, quotas, emergency powers.
- Control seeks legitimacy: paper doors are easier to force than real ones.
- Ren’s answer is boundary + practice: refusal, repair, and auditable work.

## Key Terms (quick reference)

- **Paper doors**: treaties/permits/committees that turn access into ownership.
- **Emergency powers**: “temporary” authority that becomes permanent under fear.
- **Narrative sabotage**: engineered incidents (burned carts, rumors) used to sell the need for a center.
