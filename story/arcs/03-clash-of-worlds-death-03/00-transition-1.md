[Next →](01-transition-2.md)


## Characters

- **Introduced / First appearance**:
	- Cart driver (unnamed)
	- Tea house keeper (unnamed)
- **Returning**:
	- Ren
	- Master Jian (Cloud-Splitting)
	- The seam / corridor
- **Changes (status / power / gear / role)**:
	- The seam becomes measurable: touching “ordinary” anchors can trigger thinness and a bodily toll
	- Ren learns danger expands: intention/proximity can be enough to stir the corridor
	- Master Jian pivots from revolt to pursuit-as-protection: questions create witnesses instead of prey
- **Relationships / allegiances**:
	- Ren ↔ seam: a coercive relationship framed as payment
	- Master Jian ↔ Ren: tries to track without turning Ren into property

## Scene 1

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: A countryside road outside the city
- **Goal**: Move without being followed; learn what the door costs to touch

The road was ordinary until it wasn’t.

Dust that rose in soft clouds when carts passed.

Ruts that held old rain like stubborn memory.

Farmers who stared at travelers like travelers were problems that might multiply.

Ren kept his hood up.

Not to hide his face.

To hide his intentions.

In the city, intentions had been loud.

In the square, intentions had been weapons.

Out here, intentions were what got you followed.

He walked with his steps measured, not because he was calm, but because his body had learned something new about motion.

When you could make a door, every footstep felt like a choice between the world and the corridor.

Ren kept the seam inside him quiet.

Or tried to.

Sometimes quiet was not a decision.

Sometimes quiet was a negotiation.

The countryside sounded normal at first—birds, wind moving through low trees, the distant clatter of a cart.

Then he blinked too long.

And the corridor returned.

Not a memory.

An afterimage.

Like staring at a bright lamp and then looking away.

Only the lamp, in this case, had been a place that hated him.

Ren’s throat tightened.

He forced himself to focus on the road.

On the ordinary.

On the simple mercy of distance that behaved.

Behind him, the city was a bruise on the horizon.

Ahead, the road curved toward low hills and a thin line of trees.

A cart approached from the opposite direction.

Ren moved to the side.

The driver—a man with sun-darkened skin and a face that looked carved by worry—watched Ren without blinking.

“You coming from the basin?” the man asked.

Ren shrugged.

“From the city,” he said.

The man spat.

“City’s eating itself,” he muttered.

Then, quieter:

“And the white uniforms are learning to eat with it.

They don’t ask the nobles anymore.

They ask the road.”

Ren did not argue.

He watched the cart roll past.

Watched the sacks.

Watched the driver’s hands.

Hands that carried food had started getting guarded in a way swords never had.

After the cart passed, Ren walked faster.

He did not like being asked questions.

Questions were how people found the shape of a rumor.

Rumors were how people found him.

And once someone found him, paper would follow.

Stamps.

Categories.

The kind of hunting that claimed it was only administration.

After a while, he saw the milestone.

Stone, half-buried at the roadside, carved with numbers and names worn down by weather.

Ren stopped.

Not because he was tired.

Because the seam inside him tugged.

He stared at the milestone.

It was ordinary.

Which meant it could be used.

He pressed his palm to it.

For a heartbeat, the world felt thin.

Ren’s breath caught.

The air around his hand did not move.

It listened.

Behind the milestone, he heard a child laugh.

Ren’s stomach dropped.

There was no child.

He pulled his hand away.

The thinness snapped back into normal.

Ren stood very still.

He waited for the corridor to do something.

It did not.

But he felt the payment.

Not coins.

Not blood.

Something subtler.

A moment of dizziness.

A small, humiliating tear at the corner of his eye.

The taste of ash in his mouth, though there was no ash here.

Ren touched his lip.

His fingers came away red.

He stared at the smear.

So that was the cost.

Not immediate death.

Not immediate punishment.

Just a toll taken from the body as if the body were a purse.

Ren wiped his fingers on his sleeve.

He understood then: the seam was not a tool.

It was a relationship.

And relationships demanded payment.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: A roadside ditch and a small grove
- **Goal**: Avoid attention; test whether the seam reacts to fear

He left the milestone behind and cut off the road into a shallow ditch, then into a grove where the trees were thin and the ground smelled damp.

Ren crouched behind a trunk.

He listened.

Footsteps, faint.

Not close.

But present.

Ren closed his eyes.

In his mind, the corridor unfolded.

He imagined the absence shaped like a door.

He imagined it listening.

He did not open it.

He simply held the thought.

His chest tightened.

The seam inside him twitched.

Ren felt the air thin for the briefest instant.

He opened his eyes.

The grove was unchanged.

But Ren understood a new danger.

The seam could be triggered by proximity.

Not by hands.

By intention.

Ren let out a slow breath.

He forced his thoughts away from doors.

He thought about food.

About water.

About the boy’s sob in the corridor.

About the cook’s silent crying when the wind hit her face.

The seam quieted.

Ren waited until the footsteps faded.

Then he returned to the road.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Master Jian (Cloud-Splitting)
- **Location**: A traveling tea house
- **Goal**: Track Ren without turning him into a prisoner

Master Jian did not hunt.

Hunting made prey.

He asked questions.

Questions made witnesses.

At the tea house, the air smelled of boiled leaves and smoke and tiredness.

People sat with their backs to walls.

People spoke in low voices.

The world outside the city had learned from the city’s panic.

Master Jian ordered tea.

Not because he wanted it.

Because ordering tea made you look like someone who belonged.

The woman behind the counter watched him with narrow eyes.

“You’re not from here,” she said.

“No,” Master Jian agreed.

She poured anyway.

“Then why are you asking about travelers?” she asked.

Master Jian chose his words with care.

“Because someone is being hunted,” he said.

The woman snorted.

“Everyone’s being hunted,” she replied. “By hunger, if nothing else.”

Master Jian nodded.

“A young man,” he said. “Tired eyes. Careful hands.”

Her expression shifted.

Recognition.

Then caution.

“He came through,” she admitted. “Bought bread.”

Master Jian set a coin on the counter.

The coin did not buy information.

It bought a pause.

“He paid twice,” the woman said.

“Why?” Master Jian asked.

She shrugged.

“Because he looked like someone who owed a debt to the world,” she said. “Because he looked like he’d walked out of a place that shouldn’t exist.”

She glanced at Master Jian’s coin.

“And because he bled into his sleeve like he didn’t want anyone to see,” she added.

Master Jian’s throat tightened.

He did not know the seamwalker’s name.

But he understood the shape of his burden.

And he understood a worse possibility.

If the seam demanded payment, then someone would eventually try to pay it with other people.

Master Jian lifted his tea.

The tea tasted bitter.

Appropriate.

## Notes

- Continuity: Establishes Death Stage 03 as travel + discovery, and introduces a tangible “toll” for touching the seam.
- Foreshadowing: If the seam takes payment, factions will try to redirect that cost onto civilians.
- Pressure: rumors become paperwork; the countryside becomes searchable.
