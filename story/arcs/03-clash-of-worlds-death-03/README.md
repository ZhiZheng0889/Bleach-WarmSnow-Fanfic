# Death Stage 03 — Clash Between Worlds (Arc Guide)

This stage bridges from the prior fallout into the next escalation.

## Core Throughline

- The court is gone, but **control** is not: the fight shifts from squares to roads, reports, and categories.
- The seam stops being metaphor: it becomes a measurable **wound** with a measurable **toll**.

## Key Terms (quick reference)

- **Seam toll**: the corridor takes payment (blood, dizziness, thinning) when touched or stirred; it invites exploitation.
- **Keys (Soul Society usage)**: a dehumanizing classification for people who can trigger anomalies; used to justify capture and control.
