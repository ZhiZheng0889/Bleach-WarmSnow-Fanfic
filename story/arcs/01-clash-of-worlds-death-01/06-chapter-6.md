## Scene 1

- **POV**: A court ritualist (House priest)
- **Location**: The public square before the white court
- **Goal**: Turn political fear into sacred certainty

The court understood something the forge never would.

People will forgive hunger.

They will not forgive humiliation.

And Hellborne, without even trying, had humiliated the ladder.

So the houses built a story tall enough to hide behind.

They called it a rite.

They called it tradition.

They called it gratitude.

The ritualist arrived before dawn while the stone was still cold and the banners still slept.

He walked the square with a wax tablet in his hands and a list of names in his mouth.

Not the names of the dead.

The names of the living who needed to believe they were protected.

At the square’s center, a basin had been placed: white marble, wide enough to bathe a child.

Its water was clear.

Too clear.

Clarity like that only existed when someone paid for it.

The ritualist checked the work crews.

The nobles had insisted the crews wear fresh cloth.

No soot.

No stains.

Clean hands were part of the message.

The message was simple:

*We are pure.*

*They are not.*

He hated how effective simplicity was.

A junior scribe approached, eyes bright with borrowed importance.

“Is the King attending?” the scribe asked.

The ritualist didn’t answer immediately.

The Spirit King was the center of the myth, but not its author.

That was the point.

“His presence is… requested,” the ritualist said.

The scribe nodded, satisfied.

Requested.

That was a polite way of saying *used*.

The ritualist tapped his wax tablet.

“Remember the phrasing,” he told the scribe. “We do not say ‘Hellborne.’

We say ‘the Black Temptation.’

We do not say ‘guild.’

We say ‘mob.’

We do not say ‘workers.’

We say ‘levies.’

Words decide what people are allowed to see.”

The scribe wrote quickly.

As the sky lightened, the square filled.

Commoners.

Clerks.

Guards.

Young nobles who came to learn how power smelled when it dressed itself as piety.

They all waited, necks craned, because a crowd is an animal that wants to be fed.

The ritualist raised his hands.

Bells rang.

Not alarms.

Invitations.

He began the Rite of Clean Hands.

First: the story of the wall.

He spoke of the Spirit King “raising mercy into stone,” of “separating suffering so it could be healed.”

He did not speak of politics.

He spoke of destiny.

Second: the story of the seam.

He spoke of “Black chains biting white stone.”

He spoke of “greed that cannot recognize holiness.”

He did not speak of hunger.

He spoke of corruption.

Third: the story of the houses.

He spoke of “stewards who keep the river flowing.”

He spoke of “oaths that prevent the strong from devouring the weak.”

The crowd murmured.

Some believed him.

Some wanted to.

Wanting was enough.

Then came the basin.

The ritualist gestured and the first noble approached—an elder whose hands had never held a hammer.

The elder dipped his fingers into the clear water.

He lifted them.

Nothing dripped.

Even the water obeyed.

“Be clean,” the ritualist said.

The elder nodded solemnly.

The crowd exhaled as if cleanliness were safety.

Next came a mid-rank noble.

Then another.

Then a court guard.

Then a clerk.

Then—carefully, performatively—a chosen commoner.

A baker’s daughter, clean-faced and terrified.

The ritualist took her hands and lowered them into the basin.

The crowd watched.

This was the real spell.

Not water.

Not prayer.

The promise that the system could touch a commoner without changing.

When her hands rose, they were wet.

The crowd laughed softly.

Relieved.

See?

The court can wash you.

You do not need the black side.

You do not need a commune.

You do not need to imagine a world without houses.

The ritualist kept his face calm.

Inwardly, he noted the risk.

If enough commoners learned to perform this rite, they might learn they didn’t need the nobles to do it.

So the final step mattered most.

He lifted his hands again.

“Speak with me,” he told the crowd. “So the world remembers.”

The chant was short.

Short things spread.

“White hands, clean hands.

Walls hold. Names bind.

Black chains, false hands.

Seams break. Oaths end.”

The crowd repeated it.

Once.

Twice.

Three times.

By the third, it sounded like truth.

The ritualist looked toward the palace.

He felt the shape of a question behind the stone.

If the Spirit King came, the myth would harden.

If he didn’t, the nobles would say he did.

Either way, the rite would work.

The ritualist thought, not without bitterness:

This is how courts win: by making fear feel holy.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: The Spirit King
- **Location**: The edge of the square (unseen by most)
- **Goal**: Avoid becoming a holy weapon while the court forges one anyway

He did not stand at the center.

He stood where the crowd’s eyes did not reach.

If he was naive, it was not because he couldn’t see.

It was because he still believed seeing would be enough.

The Spirit King watched the basin and the chant and the careful selection of a commoner who would not embarrass the story.

He watched the nobles become priests.

He watched the priests become lawmakers.

He watched law become religion.

He could see the futures this rite would create.

A child chanting it as she learned her letters.

A guard chanting it as he searched a bag.

A clerk chanting it as he denied a petition.

A noble chanting it as he signed an execution order with steady hands.

The Spirit King felt cold in his ribs.

Warm snow fell.

It fell even here, faintly—flakes like ash that refused to admit they were ash.

He remembered the First Smith’s voice.

*You see the future and you still believe people will behave.*

He had been offended.

He was still offended.

He was also beginning—slowly, painfully—to understand.

Because the court was not asking people to behave.

It was teaching them what to fear.

Fear was easier to govern than love.

The Spirit King wanted to step forward.

To interrupt.

To say: *Do not call them temptation. Do not call them mob. Do not call yourselves clean.*

He saw the futures where he did.

The nobles smiled and bowed.

Then they rewrote his words into a blessing.

They made his objection into a proof of his holiness.

They made his mercy into a chain.

He saw the futures where he condemned the rite.

The crowd recoiled.

The nobles cried betrayal.

Someone started a rumor: the King had been corrupted by the black side.

Rumor became riot.

Riot became purge.

His hands tightened.

He could choose the least blood today.

He could also choose the least blood tomorrow.

But the rite was teaching the realm to demand blood later.

He turned away from the square.

Not because he agreed.

Because he was running out of choices that did not become weapons.

Across the seam, far beyond the reach of chants, he imagined a common hall with visible stores.

He imagined a bowl passed without a surname.

He imagined a world where “clean hands” meant working hands.

He wished—dangerously—that he could believe in that world the way the crowd believed in this one.

## Notes
- Theme: The nobles weaponize mythmaking—turning class fear into sacred “cleanliness” and making Hellborne an ideological contagion.
- Worldbuilding: The first propaganda tools are language shifts (rename Hellborne) and public ritual (basin/chant) to harden social boundaries.
