# Chapter 37 — When Death Leaks

## Scene 1

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: A night street lit by cookfire and rumor
- **Goal**: Keep the habit from becoming panic; recognize the dead are walking wrong

The city had always had ghosts.

Not the kind that floated.

The kind that sat at tables and stared through soup.

Widows.

Orphans.

Men who had returned from war with their eyes still elsewhere.

Tonight it had different ghosts.

A child tugged Ren’s sleeve.

“Do you see that?” she whispered.

Ren followed her finger.

In the alley, a shape moved.

Thin.

Pale.

Too still to be alive.

It turned its head.

Its face was not a face.

It was a hole wearing a suggestion.

Ren’s throat tightened.

The shape sniffed.

Not air.

Meaning.

It took one step toward the cookfire.

People backed away.

A woman crossed herself.

A man raised a knife.

The knife shook.

Not fear.

Reluctance.

Steel was learning new rules.

Ren held up a hand.

“Don’t run,” he said.

The words felt stupid.

Running was instinct.

But panic was contagious.

And contagion fed hunger.

The thing in the alley opened its mouth.

Its mouth was too wide.

A sound came out.

Not a roar.

A suction.

As if the alley wanted to swallow the street.

Ren stepped sideways.

Placed himself between it and the cookfire.

He did not feel brave.

He felt responsible.

Responsibility was how courts were born.

He hated that.

But he did it anyway.

He tossed a bowl of broth into the alley.

It shattered.

Steam rose.

The thing recoiled.

Not from heat.

From life.

From the smell of bodies still attached to their souls.

“Back,” Ren whispered.

The thing hesitated.

Then it slid into the darkness, as if the dark had opened for it.

Ren exhaled.

The seam was open.

And the dead were not staying polite.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: A Cinderbound marshal
- **Location**: A plaza where a breach has turned air into a thin scream
- **Goal**: Fight something that is not a faction; keep his fighters from becoming prey

They found the first mouth in the open.

It stood in the plaza like a mistake.

Ash gathered around it.

Not from fire.

From absence.

The marshal’s fighters circled.

Blades up.

Breathing hard.

“Is it Compact?” a lieutenant asked.

The marshal stared at the mouth.

“It’s not anything we can punish,” he said.

The mouth turned.

It did not look at them.

It tasted them.

One fighter stepped forward.

Brave.

Stupid.

His blade struck the mouth’s edge.

The steel did not cut.

It sank.

As if the mouth was not matter.

As if it was a decision.

The fighter screamed.

Not because of pain.

Because something pulled at his name.

The marshal moved.

He grabbed the fighter by the collar.

Pulled him back.

The fighter’s eyes were wide.

“I—forgot—” he choked.

The marshal’s chest tightened.

Forgetting was death without blood.

“Hold on,” the marshal snarled.

He looked around.

Stones.

Cloth.

Water.

Anything still obedient.

“Salt!” he shouted.

Someone blinked.

“Salt?”

“Now!”

A runner sprinted.

Returned with a sack.

The marshal tore it open.

White crystals spilled.

He threw them in a ring.

The mouth recoiled.

Not because of superstition.

Because boundary meant something.

Even to hunger.

The mouth hissed.

The air thinned.

Then it folded inward and vanished.

The marshal stood shaking.

He did not feel victorious.

He felt late.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: The Spirit King
- **Location**: The soul-river’s single bed
- **Goal**: Accept the leak is systemic; realize the first clash has triggered a cosmological failure mode

The mouths were not new.

They were old.

They were the consequence of a world that insisted on being one.

One river.

One bed.

All souls pressed through the same channel.

It worked when the banks were strong.

When names held.

When courts could enforce meaning.

Now names burned.

Meaning slipped.

Banks softened.

So the river overflowed.

And in the overflow, hunger learned to stand.

He watched the marshal ring salt.

He watched Ren shield a cookfire.

He watched Gao Yue turn omen into propaganda.

Two factions still fought.

But the world had introduced a third enemy.

A leak.

A hunger.

A realm that did not want governance.

Only consumption.

He inhaled.

The decision he had been avoiding approached like a tide.

A whole world was no longer stable.

Stability would require a partition.

Not a court.

A cosmology.

## Notes

- Continuity: Supernatural “mouths” appear in the city; Ren and the marshal each respond with improvised boundary tactics, prioritizing survival over faction wins.
- Foreshadowing: The Spirit King reframes the crisis as structural—one soul-river and one world-bed can no longer contain pressure; partition becomes inevitable.
