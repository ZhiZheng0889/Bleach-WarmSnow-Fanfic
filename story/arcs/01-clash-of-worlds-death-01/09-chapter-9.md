## Scene 1

- **POV**: A court clerk (newly drafted)
- **Location**: A ration hall under white banners
- **Goal**: Turn people into entries; make hunger legible to law

The first time the clerk stamped a ration seal, his hand shook.

The second time, it didn’t.

By the tenth, he was no longer thinking about the person in front of him.

He was thinking about *flow*.

Lines.

Bottlenecks.

Whether the ink would run out before the afternoon bell.

This was how escalation worked:

You stopped calling it violence.

You called it administration.

A woman stepped forward, cheeks hollow, palms open.

“Name,” the clerk said.

“Shen,” she whispered.

“Surname.”

The woman hesitated.

“I… don’t have—”

The clerk looked up.

Behind her, the line shifted like a tired animal.

A guard’s gaze sharpened.

The clerk’s supervisor—an older man with lacquered sleeves and a smile that never reached his eyes—leaned in.

“Everyone has a surname now,” the supervisor murmured.

The clerk swallowed.

“House-assigned surname,” he repeated, as if the words were normal. “Choose from the list.”

He slid a board toward the woman.

It held twelve characters.

Simple.

Common.

Easy to sort.

The woman’s lips moved as she read.

Her finger hovered.

Then landed.

The clerk wrote it down.

He stamped the seal.

A white circle on a strip of paper, a center that promised food.

The woman clutched it as if it were a talisman.

It *was* a talisman.

Not magic.

Worse.

Consensus.

Next came a man with callused hands.

“Occupation,” the clerk asked.

“Carpenter.”

“Registered workshop?”

“No.”

The clerk’s supervisor sighed theatrically.

“Unregistered labor is a vector for Hellborne influence,” the supervisor said, loud enough for the line to hear. “You will be assigned.”

The carpenter’s face hardened.

“I work where I’m paid.”

The guard shifted.

The clerk felt his stomach twist.

He wanted to say, *Run.*

Instead, he heard himself say:

“Sign here.”

The carpenter signed.

Or rather, he pressed his thumb into ink and left a print.

The clerk stamped it.

A seal for food.

A seal for belonging.

And—quietly, invisibly—a seal for control.

Across the hall, a banner hung:

**THE REGISTRY OF BREATH**

A slogan beneath it:

**IF YOU ARE COUNTED, YOU ARE PROTECTED.**

The clerk understood the unspoken clause.

If you are not counted, you are prey.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Lady Gao Yue
- **Location**: A Marble Compact council chamber
- **Goal**: Escalate from rationing to enforcement; turn the Ten Sects into “outlaws” by definition

Lady Gao Yue listened to the reports.

Three ration halls opened.

Two attacked.

One burned.

The pattern was predictable.

The Ten Sects could not tolerate a registry.

The Hellborne could not tolerate a monopoly on food.

And the people—those who lived between banners like grass between stones—could not tolerate dying.

Gao Yue’s scribe read aloud.

“‘Incident at Canal Bridge Three: sect vice leader observed resisting registration. Crowd agitation escalated. One guard dead.’”

Lord Qiao slammed his cup down.

“They kill our guards now,” he snarled.

“They kill our *symbols*,” Gao Yue corrected. “That’s the difference.”

Lady Lin leaned forward.

“Then we escalate the symbols,” she said.

Gao Yue nodded.

“Yes,” she replied. “We make resistance look like an attack on the hungry.”

She turned to the council’s newest addition: a man in priestly robes, the same kind who performed the Rite of Clean Hands.

“Can you sanctify the registry?” she asked.

The priest did not hesitate.

“I can sanctify anything people already fear,” he said.

“Good,” Gao Yue replied.

She placed a new document on the table.

**THE BREATH EDICT**

It was short.

Short laws spread.

“Any who refuse the Registry of Breath shall be deemed outside the Compact,” Gao Yue read. “Any who obstruct the registry shall be deemed bandit. Any who shelter bandits shall be deemed collaborator.”

Lord Qiao’s smile returned.

“And the sects?”

Gao Yue’s eyes stayed calm.

“The Ten Sects won’t register,” she said. “They can’t. Their authority is based on being above counting.”

Lady Lin’s voice softened.

“So we make them illegal.”

Gao Yue nodded.

“Not by defeating them,” she said. “By defining them.”

She signed first.

Ink.

Center stamp.

The others followed.

By midnight, the Breath Edict was posted on every bridge.

And the nobles had escalated again—turning hunger into a legal weapon.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Lady Qiu Ren
- **Location**: An alley near a ration hall
- **Goal**: Realize the battlefield has moved from blades to paperwork

Ren watched a child trade a ration seal for half a loaf.

The child’s hands were too small to hold the paper steady.

The baker’s hands shook as he took it.

Not from greed.

From relief.

A seal meant he could buy flour.

No seal meant his oven would go dark.

Ren’s chest tightened.

This was why the Ten Sects lost battles without losing fights.

They were trained to break formations.

Not systems.

A Cloud-Splitting disciple approached her, face grim.

“Vice-Leader,” he whispered. “The Houses posted new edicts. They’re calling us bandits.”

Ren stared at the paper nailed to the wall.

She read the short, clean characters.

Bandit.

Collaborator.

Outside protection.

Ren understood then, with a clarity that made her nauseous:

The nobles weren’t trying to kill the Ten Sects.

They were trying to make the realm feel safe *without them*.

That was escalation too.

Ren turned away from the wall.

“We need our own seals,” she said.

Her disciple blinked.

“Seals?”

“Food,” Ren said. “Names. Proof. Something the hungry can hold.”

She hated herself for thinking like a court.

But hate didn’t feed anyone.

## Notes
- Continuity: Marble Compact evolves into Registry of Breath (ration seals + legal exclusion).
- Continuity: Ten Sects begin to realize administration is a battlefield.
- Foreshadowing: Competing ‘seals’ sets up later ideological war: who has the right to count souls.
