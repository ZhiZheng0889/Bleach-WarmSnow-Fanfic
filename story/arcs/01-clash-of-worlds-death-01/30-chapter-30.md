## Scene 1

- **POV**: A Cinderbound marshal
- **Location**: Inner cordon breach point
- **Goal**: Keep the streak alive; prove marble is only a surface

They had expected walls.

The marshal expected traps.

Marble did not want to be climbed.

Marble wanted you to behave.

He watched his fighters prepare.

No banners.

No proclamation.

Only rope, hooks, and short blades.

A runner whispered.

“Quartermaster says don’t get trapped inside.”

The marshal smiled.

“Then we don’t go inside,” he replied.

The runner blinked.

“But the court—”

The marshal’s smile sharpened.

“The court is a stage,” he said. “We cut the lights.”

He pointed to the cordon’s hinges.

To the gates’ iron pins.

To the supply of water carts.

To the patrol corridor that fed the line.

Continuous victory was not always forward.

Sometimes it was sideways.

Sometimes it was removing the enemy’s ability to hold.

He lifted his hand.

A small signal.

Runners moved.

Not at the gate.

At the hinges.

Tar.

Ash.

A spark.

The hinge smoked.

The gate did not burn.

It weakened.

A quiet failure.

The kind that made strong things suddenly admit they were made of parts.

The marshal watched the guards react.

They shouted.

They raised spears.

They asked for orders.

Orders arrived as paper.

Paper arrived too slow.

The marshal smiled.

All talk.

No steel.

He lifted his blade.

“Now,” he said.

And his fighters hit the gate.

Not to smash.

To exploit.

The hinge pin snapped.

The gate sagged.

Then the cordon opened like a mouth forced.

The marshal surged through.

The palace district air smelled different.

Clean.

Polished.

Like a lie.

He laughed.

“This is it?” he called.

His voice echoed off marble.

“Is this your fortress?”

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Captain Liang
- **Location**: Palace district corridors
- **Goal**: Prevent the breach from reaching the registry hall; turn corridors into kill zones

Liang heard the cordon fail.

Not as a sound.

As a pressure change.

The palace district’s breath shortened.

He ran through corridors that had been built for ceremony.

Ceremony made you slow.

Slow made you dead.

A lieutenant met him.

“Breach,” the lieutenant gasped.

Liang nodded.

“We fall back,” he ordered.

The lieutenant stared.

“Already?”

Liang’s jaw clenched.

“Already,” he repeated.

Because he had learned a lesson the nobles refused to learn.

You did not win by pretending you were strong.

You won by making the enemy pay for every step.

Liang pointed.

“Seal that corridor,” he said. “Collapse that archway. Block the stairs.”

The lieutenant blinked.

“That’s… destroying the palace,” he said.

Liang’s voice was flat.

“The palace is a building,” he said. “The Compact is a claim. Keep the claim alive.”

A priest appeared, eyes wide.

“You can’t collapse sacred corridors!” he hissed.

Liang’s gaze hardened.

“Sacred doesn’t stop fire,” he said.

The priest flinched.

Liang did not wait.

He ran.

He reached the registry hall’s antechamber.

Clerks huddled inside like frightened birds.

Lists on tables.

Stamps ready.

Names waiting to be eaten.

Liang’s stomach turned.

If the Cinderbound reached this hall, victory would become governance.

They would own names.

They would become the next court.

Liang shouted.

“Burn the records!”

A clerk stared.

“What?”

Liang’s voice cracked.

“Burn them,” he repeated.

The clerk’s hands shook.

“But Lady Gao—”

Liang snarled.

“Lady Gao is not here!”

The same physics.

A clerk burst into tears.

Liang grabbed a stack of forms and threw them into the brazier.

Paper curled.

Ink blackened.

A list became smoke.

The clerks stared.

Liang’s throat tightened.

He had become what he hated.

A man using fire as policy.

But he saw the alternative.

Cinderbound holding the Name-Eater.

Cinderbound holding the registry.

Cinderbound writing the new categories.

No.

Better ash than a new stamp.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Lady Gao Yue
- **Location**: A sealed chamber behind the throne screens
- **Goal**: Preserve legitimacy as the palace district is breached; decide which truth to sacrifice

Lady Gao Yue felt the breach before anyone told her.

Because architecture had a voice.

It creaked when frightened.

A priest arrived, sweating.

“They’re inside the palace district,” he gasped.

Lady Gao Yue’s throat tightened.

She did not show it.

“Then we activate the last seal,” she said.

The priest blinked.

“The last seal is—”

“It is what it is,” Lady Gao Yue cut in.

The last seal was not a wall.

It was a ritual.

A binding of movement.

A way to make corridors feel heavy.

Not enough to stop fighters.

Enough to slow them.

Slowness was sometimes the only steel you had.

She turned toward the screens.

“Bring me the remaining scrolls,” she said.

A clerk hesitated.

“Lady,” the clerk whispered, “if they take the scrolls—”

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze sharpened.

“They will not,” she said.

Not confidence.

Command.

The clerk ran.

Lady Gao Yue stood alone for a heartbeat.

She listened to distant shouting.

Metal on stone.

Bodies running.

A palace learning it was not a fortress.

She exhaled.

All talk.

No steel.

She had always known it.

She had simply believed talk was enough.

Now she needed a different kind of talk.

Not laws.

Myth.

She would frame the breach as sacrilege.

She would call the Cinderbound desecrators.

She would call the sects collaborators.

She would call hunger loyalty.

She would do what courts did.

She would narrate.

Even as the marble cracked.

## Notes

- Continuity: The Cinderbound breach the inner cordon by attacking infrastructure (hinges/supply) rather than walls; Liang turns to scorched-paper defense, burning registry records to deny the enemy governance tools; Gao Yue prepares a final slowing seal and a narrative escalation.
- Foreshadowing: The conflict peaks at the registry/scrolls: if any faction holds naming tools, they become a court; burning records buys time but accelerates chaos and hunger.
