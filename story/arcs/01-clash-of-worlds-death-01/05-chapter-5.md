## Scene 1

- **POV**: A court noble (mid-rank)
- **Location**: The white court, after the seam disturbance
- **Goal**: Turn fear into legitimacy

The nobles did not fear Hell because Hell was strong.

They feared Hell because Hell was *demonstrative*.

It did not merely kill.

It explained.

It showed, in public, with soot under its nails and ledgers on its tables, that the ladder was made of wood.

And wood could burn.

In the days after the seam trembled, the court became busy in the way a hive becomes busy when the first smoke arrives.

Messengers ran.

Clerks wrote.

Scribes copied the same decree five different ways so it could sound inevitable.

And the nobles smiled through it all, because nobles were trained to treat panic like etiquette.

The mid-rank lord—young enough to still remember being hungry once, old enough to have forgotten what hunger did to his face—watched the hall fill.

Across from him stood the higher houses.

They wore clean silk.

They wore clean righteousness.

They wore the kind of calm that was not calm at all, but rather the certainty that any disaster could be made someone else’s responsibility.

A senior noble spoke first.

“An incursion,” she said, “is not a theft attempt.

It is a philosophy.

It is an insult to the order that keeps us alive.”

The mid-rank lord nodded along, because nodding was safer than thinking.

But he heard the subtext anyway.

*If they can breach a palace today, they can breach a title tomorrow.*

*If they can pull scrap from the white side, they can pull obedience from the commons.*

The senior noble continued.

“They call themselves guilds,” she said, as if the word tasted like rust.

“They claim their leaders are no different from their workers.”

Several nobles laughed politely.

The mid-rank lord did too.

The laughter sounded wrong in his mouth.

Because the idea was absurd.

And because the idea was contagious.

He had seen the way the lower ranks looked at the seam guards now.

Not with gratitude.

With curiosity.

As if asking:

*If the black side can train anyone to fight and forge… what exactly do you do that is sacred?*

The mid-rank lord’s throat tightened.

That question was the real breach.

Not chains through stone.

A thought through a social wall.

The Spirit King was not in the hall.

That absence was its own kind of terror.

When the king was present, the nobles could perform virtue.

When he was absent, they had to decide what virtue was useful.

A clerk read a proposed decree.

“By authority of the court,” the clerk intoned, “the classification of ranks is reaffirmed as a stability measure. Unauthorized fraternization with black-side operatives is prohibited. Possession of foreign-forged implements will be punished as treason.”

The word *treason* landed like a heavy stone.

It was a simple solution.

If you cannot prove your superiority by reality, you prove it by law.

The mid-rank lord listened to the murmurs.

Some nobles were pleased.

Some were relieved.

Some were hungry for it.

He thought of the First Smith—he had never met him, but the name had begun to circulate like a disease—and imagined a hall where rations were visible and leadership rotated.

He hated the image.

Not because it sounded cruel.

Because it sounded like it could work.

A junior noble leaned close and whispered, “If the commons learn they can live without houses, what do they need us for?”

The mid-rank lord almost flinched.

The question was too honest.

It should not have been spoken in a court.

But fear made people careless.

And Hell, apparently, had brought fear into the white side like soot on the wind.

He answered the only way a noble could answer.

“They need us,” he said, “because we say they do.”

The junior noble smiled, relieved.

The mid-rank lord felt sick.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: The Spirit King
- **Location**: The seam, under warm snow
- **Goal**: Prevent the court from turning fear into a permanent war engine

The Spirit King stood where warm snow fell and did not melt.

He could feel both worlds tugging at him.

The white side demanded that he be a symbol.

The black side demanded that he be a problem.

He looked down at the seamwork scars—fresh struts, tightened seals, evidence of contact.

He could see futures where the court’s decree became doctrine.

He could see banners.

He could see inquisitors.

He could see a generation trained to believe that obedience was the same as safety.

He could also see futures where the court did nothing.

Where the black side returned, again and again, until a breach stopped being a breach and became a road.

He could see a world where the nobles were right.

He could see a world where the First Smith was right.

Seeing did not make choosing easier.

Sometimes it only made you complicit in whichever pain you chose.

The Spirit King exhaled.

He remembered, briefly, the first meeting.

How clean everything had been.

How possible.

How his friend had looked at him as if looking at a person rather than a fate.

Friend.

Nemesis.

He felt the court behind him like a hand on his shoulder.

Not gentle.

Possessive.

He heard their fear in the shape of their policies.

They did not fear Hell’s weapons.

They feared Hell’s *example*.

That was what made it dangerous.

The Spirit King looked into the black slit and spoke, softly, to whatever listened.

“You want to prove the ladder is wood,” he said.

The warm snow swirled.

He could not see the First Smith.

But he could feel him the way you feel heat through a wall.

“And they want to prove it’s the sky,” the Spirit King continued.

He closed his eyes.

In one future, he ordered a purge.

The nobles praised him.

The commons feared him.

Hell hardened.

War became law.

In another future, he abolished the houses.

Hell laughed.

The nobles revolted.

The realm shattered.

In most futures, the difference between those choices was only the order of disasters.

The Spirit King opened his eyes.

A flake of warm snow landed on his palm.

He watched it sit there, refusing to melt.

There were truths like that.

Truths that would not dissolve just because a court demanded they do.

He turned back toward the white side.

Toward the court.

Toward the decrees that were already being written in his name.

He did not feel anger.

He felt something worse.

He felt understanding.

And understanding, he knew, was how naive boys became kings.

## Notes
- Theme: The court’s fear is class fear—Hellborne threatens ranks by demonstrating competence is teachable and legitimacy is constructed.
- Foreshadowing: Early “anti-Hellborne” policy becomes the seed of later institutional paranoia.
