## Scene 1

- **POV**: Lady Gao Yue
- **Location**: The Marble Compact’s council chamber (behind the public court)
- **Goal**: Contain the Spirit King’s speech by re-owning the language it introduced

The speech did not end when he stopped speaking.

That was the first failure.

Lady Gao Yue sat with her hands folded on the lacquered table and watched the council attempt to treat it like a finished object.

As if words were a petition you could file.

As if meaning held still.

A clerk read aloud the report from the square.

“He refused to crown the Compact,” the clerk said. “He acknowledged hunger. He instructed the crowd to—”

The clerk paused.

Lady Gao Yue noticed the pause before anyone else did.

Not because she was sharper.

Because she was listening for the moment language became dangerous.

“To count them back,” the clerk finished.

Silence.

Not reverent.

Not respectful.

The silence of people realizing a phrase had escaped the cage.

A councilman slammed his palm on the table.

“Treason,” he spat.

Lady Gao Yue did not react.

“Treason is a category,” she said. “Categories are tools. Do not insult me by using them as emotions.”

Another noble leaned forward.

“We should move to declare him compromised,” he said.

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze slid to him.

“Declare the King compromised,” she repeated.

He flinched.

Not because she was cruel.

Because he heard the stupidity in his own sentence.

A ruler could be attacked.

A symbol could be questioned.

But if you declared the axis false, the floor did not become yours.

It became *nobody’s*.

And in that emptiness, anything crawled in.

“The crowd heard him,” Lady Gao Yue continued. “You cannot erase hearing. You can only compete with it.”

A priest cleared his throat.

“Then we must restate the doctrine,” he said.

Lady Gao Yue looked at him.

Doctrine.

It had served them for generations.

It had also failed within a single week to satisfy a mouth.

“The doctrine is fine,” she said. “The mouth is the problem.”

A ripple of unease.

“We cannot punish mouths,” a councilwoman said.

Lady Gao Yue’s smile was thin.

“We punish actions,” she said.

She leaned forward.

“And we define which sounds count as actions.”

The council stilled.

She placed a sheet of paper on the table.

Not a petition.

Not an edict.

A form.

At the top, in clean script:

**THE CIVIC VOW OF MEASURED TONGUE**

Beneath, three lines.

- I will not repeat words that incite the counting of rulers.
- I will not question the seals that keep hunger from becoming riot.
- I will report those who refuse the basin, the registry, and the vow.

She watched them read.

A few faces hardened.

A few faces softened.

They were all, in their own way, relieved.

Because a form was familiar.

Because you could hold it.

Because it made the chaos legible.

The councilman who had shouted treason exhaled.

“We can require this,” he said.

“Yes,” Lady Gao Yue replied.

A priest’s eyes narrowed.

“Require… how?”

Lady Gao Yue’s fingers tapped the table once.

“By linking it,” she said, “to bread.”

A quiet intake of breath.

She continued, unhurried.

“Ration seals will renew only for those who have taken the vow,” she said. “The basin will witness. The clerks will record. The guards will enforce.”

The priest nodded slowly.

“And those who refuse?” he asked.

Lady Gao Yue did not look at the priest.

She looked at the councilwoman who had said mouths could not be punished.

“Those who refuse will be treated as those who wish to make hunger a weapon,” she said.

A new category without blood in its name.

A bandit without a knife.

An enemy without a uniform.

Lady Gao Yue felt the council settle.

This, they understood.

Not war.

Administration.

A clerk spoke hesitantly.

“But the King’s words—”

Lady Gao Yue cut him off.

“Will be retranslated,” she said.

The council stared.

She allowed herself a fraction of satisfaction.

Translation was a kind of conquest.

“We will repeat his speech,” she said. “With corrections. With clarifications. With the emphasis he failed to provide.”

A noble raised an eyebrow.

“We will put words in his mouth?”

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze did not waver.

“We will put a *frame* around his words,” she said. “He offered questions. We will offer answers.”

She slid a second page across.

A chant, newly drafted:

**WALLS HOLD. NAMES BIND. QUESTIONS CUT.**

Then, smaller:

**COUNT THEM BACK — COUNT YOUR OWN HUNGER.**

A neat inversion.

A way to take the phrase and make it harmless.

Make it personal.

Make it inward.

Make it ashamed.

Lady Gao Yue leaned back.

“In the street,” she said, “language is a disease. We will become its physician.”

No one objected.

Because physicians were necessary.

And because no one liked being told they were ill.

At the edge of the table, the lacquer box sat like a sleeping animal.

The petition.

The thumbprints.

The portable fear.

Lady Gao Yue did not look at it.

She did not need it now.

She had found a better stamp.

A vow.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Court herald
- **Location**: The white court’s outer steps and basin
- **Goal**: Make a new ritual stick; stop the crowd from repeating the wrong sentence

The herald had memorized three hundred formal greetings.

None of them mattered.

He could feel the square like a wound.

The Spirit King’s voice had passed through it and left behind an itch.

People scratched at the itch with questions.

Questions were contagious.

The priests told him to speak louder.

The guards told him to speak faster.

Lady Gao Yue told him to speak *cleaner*.

Clean language.

Measured language.

Language that did not invite improvisation.

The basin waited at the center of the square, marble lip polished until it looked like it had never held anything dirty.

The herald stood at the basin’s edge and watched clerks lay out stacks of the new forms.

**THE CIVIC VOW OF MEASURED TONGUE**

Each paper had a blank for a name.

A blank for a seal.

A blank for a thumbprint.

The herald swallowed.

The blank for a name was the most dangerous part.

Names were hooks.

Hooks could pull.

The priest approached him.

“You will begin with the chant,” the priest said.

The herald nodded.

He had begun with the chant yesterday.

Yesterday, the chant had broken.

Not entirely.

Just enough to frighten the people who depended on it.

A crowd gathered again.

A smaller crowd than the day of the King’s speech.

But tighter.

More watchful.

More hungry.

A guard whispered to him.

“Any sign of sect runners?”

The herald did not answer.

He could not tell sect runners from laborers anymore.

Everyone looked like someone who could run.

He raised his hands.

“In the name of the Marble Compact—”

The crowd answered, automatically.

“WALLS HOLD. NAMES BIND.”

Relief loosened the priest’s shoulders.

The chant held.

The herald continued, careful.

“WALLS HOLD. NAMES BIND. QUESTIONS CUT.”

The last phrase landed wrong.

Not because it was false.

Because it was too honest.

A woman near the canal edge flinched.

A man in the middle hesitated.

A whisper ran like a thin crack.

“Questions cut,” someone repeated.

Another voice, lower:

“Who gets cut?”

The herald felt sweat prick at his spine.

He moved quickly.

“The Civic Vow of Measured Tongue will be taken,” he announced. “By all who wish to renew their ration seals.”

A murmur.

The crowd shifted.

Bread came back into the sentence.

When bread entered, philosophy retreated.

The herald gestured to the clerks.

“Step forward,” he said. “State your name. Mark your thumb. Touch the basin. Receive your seal.”

The first in line was a thin old man.

He spoke his name.

The clerk wrote it.

The old man pressed his thumb into ink and then to paper.

He touched the basin.

Nothing happened.

The clerk stamped his ration seal.

The old man stepped away.

The system breathed.

The priest exhaled.

Then a young woman stepped forward.

She held no form.

She held no ink.

She looked at the basin as if it were a mouth.

“What if I don’t vow?” she asked.

The herald’s rehearsed lines rose to his tongue.

He could have said: then you do not receive.

He could have said: then you are bandit.

He could have said: then you are threat.

But the Spirit King’s voice still echoed in the square, not in sound but in structure.

If someone must count you in order to protect you, then you must demand the right to count them back.

The herald felt the phrase tug at his throat.

He hated it.

Because it made him feel like his own mouth belonged to someone else.

He swallowed.

“The vow is voluntary,” he lied.

Lady Gao Yue had told him not to lie.

But she had also told him to keep the system from cracking.

The young woman smiled, small.

“Then I won’t,” she said.

A ripple.

The priest stepped forward, face hard.

“Then you will not be sealed,” the priest said.

The young woman’s smile did not leave.

“Then I will be hungry,” she said.

Her tone was not accusation.

Just arithmetic.

Behind her, someone whispered:

“Count them back.”

The priest’s eyes snapped to the sound.

Guards moved.

The herald’s stomach dropped.

The chant had held.

The form existed.

The basin waited.

And still, a single sentence slid under the marble like water under a door.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Lady Qiu Ren
- **Location**: Back alleys, laundry lines, and a temple courtyard turned clinic
- **Goal**: Spread counter-seals faster than the vow spreads fear; keep the Ten Sects from being defined as “questioners”

Ren carried the counter-seals in a cloth pouch that had once held rice.

Now it held a different kind of hunger.

Each counter-seal was simple.

Not a weapon.

Not an edict.

A small stamped charm with ink that did not look like ink.

Mother Trinity had mixed it.

A paste of ash and salt and crushed herbs.

A thing that smelled like kitchens and funerals.

Ren had not believed it would work.

That was how she knew it was the right kind of tool.

Weapons were obvious.

Infrastructure was quiet.

In the courtyard, women stood in line with bruised wrists.

Men stood with their mouths shut.

Children stood too close to their parents, as if proximity could become armor.

A healer pressed a counter-seal to a man’s ration paper.

The ink sank in.

The paper warmed.

The man blinked.

“What is it?” he whispered.

“A way to share without signing yourself into a cage,” the healer murmured.

Ren watched the exchange.

The counter-seal did not erase the Compact’s stamp.

It sat beside it.

Two marks.

Two claims.

That was the point.

If the Compact demanded monopoly, then resistance had to be plural.

A vice leader approached Ren under the shadow of a tree.

Seven Sword.

Yan.

He looked like someone who had stopped sleeping because sleep made him vulnerable to names.

“They’re issuing a vow,” he said.

Ren did not flinch.

“We knew they would,” she replied.

Yan’s mouth tightened.

“They are linking it to bread,” he said.

Ren’s fingers curled around the pouch.

“That’s why we’re here,” she said.

Yan’s gaze swept the courtyard.

“People are taking it,” he said.

Ren nodded once.

“People take what keeps them alive,” she said.

Yan’s voice lowered.

“They’re calling those who refuse ‘questioners’,” he said. “As if doubt is a crime.”

Ren’s stomach tightened.

A name.

A category.

A hook.

“Questioners,” she repeated.

Yan nodded.

“And they’re drafting patrol lists,” he said. “They’re using the registry to find mouths that don’t chant.”

Ren thought of Jian.

Of the laborer’s eyes in the crowd.

Not loyal.

Not brave.

Just tired.

She swallowed.

“We can’t fight patrols with swords,” she said.

Yan’s expression was blank.

“We can,” he said.

Ren shook her head.

“We can’t win,” she corrected.

Yan did not argue.

That was worse.

It meant he agreed.

A shadow moved near the courtyard gate.

Ren turned.

A Cinderbound recruiter leaned against the wall like he belonged there.

His clothes were dark.

His smile was bright.

He watched the line of bruised wrists and hungry children with the attentive calm of a man inspecting inventory.

Ren’s hand went to the pouch.

Not for a weapon.

For the counter-seals.

He lifted two fingers in greeting.

“Lady Qiu,” he called softly.

Ren’s blood cooled.

He knew her name.

Yan stepped forward, hand on his blade.

The recruiter’s smile widened.

“Easy,” he said. “I’m not here to fight.”

Ren’s voice was flat.

“Then why are you here?”

The recruiter looked at the clinic.

“At the only people in the city doing something useful,” he said.

Ren felt anger flare.

Useful.

A word that courts used to justify cages.

A word that armies used to justify graves.

The recruiter continued.

“The Compact is teaching people to fear their own mouths,” he said. “You are teaching them to cheat the system.”

Ren’s jaw tightened.

“We are teaching them to live,” she said.

The recruiter nodded.

“Exactly,” he said. “And living people need protection.”

Yan’s blade slid a fraction from its sheath.

Ren raised a hand.

The recruiter’s gaze remained on Ren.

“We can provide protection,” he said.

Ren’s stomach turned.

Protection.

The same sweet word.

The same excuse.

“What do you want?” she asked.

The recruiter’s smile did not shift.

“A partnership,” he said.

Ren stared.

“We don’t partner with Hellborne,” she said.

The recruiter chuckled.

“You already are,” he replied. “Every time the Compact swings, and you catch the people they knock down.”

Ren’s hand tightened on the pouch.

He was not wrong.

That was the worst part.

The recruiter’s voice softened.

“Let us take the patrols,” he said. “Let us break the vow lines. Let us make the Compact bleed in public.”

Yan’s eyes hardened.

Ren’s throat tightened.

If the Compact bled, people might stop believing in marble.

If the Compact bled, people might also believe in fire.

Ren met the recruiter’s eyes.

“And then what?” she asked.

The recruiter’s smile sharpened.

“Then,” he said, “they will beg for stronger walls.”

Ren felt the trap.

Not a trap laid for her.

A trap laid for the city.

She stepped closer, just enough to be heard.

“No,” she said.

The recruiter’s smile did not vanish.

It only became patient.

“As you like,” he said. “But remember, Lady Qiu—”

Ren’s fingers twitched.

He leaned in.

“Language is a battlefield,” he whispered. “And you are outnumbered by people who don’t care if they burn it down.”

Then he stepped back, bowed, and melted into the alley.

Yan exhaled.

Ren did not.

She looked at the clinic line.

At the counter-seals sinking into paper.

At the hungry hands reaching.

The Compact had built a vow to control mouths.

Ren had built a counter-seal to keep mouths alive.

And somewhere between them, the city’s future learned how to speak.

## Notes

- Continuity: The Marble Compact responds directly to the Spirit King’s refusal and “count them back” line by creating the Civic Vow of Measured Tongue and tying it to ration-seal renewal; Ren continues counter-seal distribution via a Mother Trinity clinic network.
- Foreshadowing: “Questioners” becomes a legal category; Cinderbound attempt to turn language-conflict into street war; counter-seals create a parallel infrastructure that will force the Compact into more aggressive enforcement.
