## Scene 1

- **POV**: Lady Gao Yue
- **Location**: The Marble Compact war-room (maps pinned with wax)
- **Goal**: Turn domestic instability into outward motion; begin the invasion on her terms

When a city begins to argue with itself, rulers do not ask it to be calmer.

They give it a direction.

Lady Gao Yue stood over a map that was not honest.

Maps never were.

They pretended that lines were facts.

They pretended that rivers were boundaries.

They pretended that the lives between ink marks did not matter.

The clerk had drawn the city in clean squares, the palace district a pale jewel, the canal a vein, the outer wards a smudge.

Beyond the smudge, the clerk had left a blank.

Blank was where the sects hid.

Blank was where the Cinderbound recruited.

Blank was where hunger came from when it wore boots.

A councilman leaned in.

“Raids on clinics continue,” he said. “The counter-seal network has become… diffuse.”

Diffuse was a polite word.

It meant: we cannot cut it out.

A priest touched the edge of the map with two fingers.

“The Quiet Tongue Decree is holding,” he said.

Holding.

Like a wall.

Like a hand on a throat.

Like a lid on boiling water.

Lady Gao Yue listened without nodding.

Holding was not winning.

Holding was what you did while the other side learned.

She looked at the lacquer box on the shelf.

The petition still slept inside it.

The thumbprints.

The portable fear.

It had failed to become a crown.

But it had taught her something more useful.

People did not want ideology.

They wanted a reason their suffering had an address.

“We are losing the street,” the councilwoman said quietly.

Not losing the guards.

Not losing the clerks.

Losing the *belief* that the guards and clerks were the only way to live.

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze stayed on the map.

“No,” she corrected.

They turned to her.

She continued.

“We are losing the illusion that the street is a room,” she said. “It is not. It is a corridor.”

The councilman frowned.

“A corridor to where?”

Lady Gao Yue placed a marker on the blank beyond the smudge.

“To the place we have refused to name,” she said.

The priest’s eyes narrowed.

“The outer wards,” he said.

“The grain routes,” the councilwoman added.

“The sect enclaves,” the councilman muttered.

Lady Gao Yue’s voice did not rise.

“We will begin an expedition,” she said.

The room stilled.

Expedition was a clean word for invasion.

It implied discovery.

It implied necessity.

It implied that the people being marched toward were not quite people.

A noble frowned.

“We do not have the manpower,” he said.

Lady Gao Yue looked at him.

“We have mouths,” she replied.

He blinked.

She continued.

“The city has been trained to fear speaking,” she said. “Let them speak through action. Let them chant with their feet.”

A priest’s fingers tightened on his prayer beads.

“To cleanse?” he asked.

Lady Gao Yue did not smile.

“To secure,” she said.

She tapped the map.

“The counter-seals move through paper,” she said. “We will move through roads. We will take the relay shrines that carry grain, salt, and messages. We will occupy the blank.”

A councilman exhaled.

“And the sects?”

Lady Gao Yue’s voice cooled.

“They will be offered compliance,” she said. “Measured speech. Recorded vows. Registry marks.”

“And if they refuse?” the councilwoman asked.

Lady Gao Yue did not look away.

“Then they will be categorized,” she said.

A pause.

Everyone in the room understood what that meant now.

A category was a coffin you could walk into.

Lady Gao Yue lifted a sealed scroll.

“The proclamation is ready,” she said.

The clerk began to read.

“By order of the Marble Compact: to secure the bread routes, to protect the citizenry, to prevent banditry and seditious questioning…”

Questioning.

Now a crime.

Now a reason to march.

Lady Gao Yue closed her eyes for a heartbeat.

Not in prayer.

In calculation.

If she kept the violence inside the city, it would rot her walls from the foundation.

If she sent it outward, it might become purpose.

Or it might become fire.

Either way, it would move.

And moving things were easier to steer than boiling ones.

She opened her eyes.

“Form the column,” she said.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Captain Liang
- **Location**: The muster yard outside the white court
- **Goal**: Turn decree-enforcers into an invading force; keep the column from fracturing on day one

They called it the White Column because white looked like legitimacy.

Captain Liang watched the lines assemble.

Not soldiers.

Peacekeepers.

Not war banners.

Ration seals.

The column carried sacks of grain on the outside—visible generosity—while the real cargo rode in lacquered cases at the center.

Forms.

Scrolls.

The Name-Eater.

Liang had sworn not to use the scroll outside “extreme necessity.”

He had learned that extreme necessity could be scheduled.

A clerk approached with a clipboard.

“Captain,” the clerk said, “the vow compliance roster is complete.”

Liang grunted.

He looked at the men and women who had taken the Civic Vow.

Measured tongue.

Quiet mouth.

The vow had not made them braver.

It had made them obedient.

Obedience, at scale, was a weapon.

A priest blessed the column.

Not with a crown.

With a phrase.

“WALLS HOLD. NAMES BIND. QUESTIONS CUT.”

The troops repeated it.

Some with conviction.

Most with hunger.

Liang’s jaw tightened.

He did not believe in chants.

He believed in supply.

He believed in terrain.

He believed in the moment a line of bodies stopped being a line and became a crowd.

Lady Gao Yue appeared at the yard’s edge.

She did not give a speech.

She did not need to.

Her presence was a form being signed by air.

Liang stepped forward and saluted.

“Column ready,” he said.

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze swept the ranks.

“Do not loot,” she said.

Liang blinked.

It was not the order he expected.

She continued.

“Looting is the language of panic,” she said. “We are not panicking. We are governing.”

Liang swallowed.

Governing.

Out there.

In the blank.

Lady Gao Yue’s voice lowered.

“You will be tempted,” she said, “to solve problems with fear.”

Liang almost laughed.

Fear was what they shipped now.

She met his eyes.

“Fear spreads too fast,” she said. “It becomes fire. Fire does not obey.”

Then she turned and left.

Liang watched the column begin to move.

White cloth fluttered.

Boots struck stone.

The city watched them go as if watching a verdict walk out of the courthouse.

Liang felt something like relief.

Movement.

Finally.

If the city was a pot about to boil over, then the column was a ladle.

He did not yet see the hand waiting to knock the ladle away.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Lady Qiu Ren
- **Location**: Rooftops near the canal gate
- **Goal**: Decide whether to shadow the invasion; keep civilians from being crushed between forces

Ren heard the column before she saw it.

A rhythm.

Not the chaotic stomp of a riot.

The deliberate cadence of an institution that had learned to move.

White cloth.

White banners.

White faces trying to look like peace.

She watched from a rooftop where laundry lines cut the air into small squares.

A child pointed.

“Where are they going?” the child asked.

No one answered.

People had learned that answers were liabilities.

Yan stood beside Ren, Seven Sword vice leader, eyes thin.

“They’re leaving the city,” he said.

Ren’s throat tightened.

“The invasion,” she replied.

Yan did not correct her.

They both knew what it was.

The Compact could not win in the streets without becoming a monster.

So it had chosen a battlefield where monsters were normal.

Ren’s hand rested on the pouch of counter-seals.

They felt lighter than they should.

As if they were trying to be smoke.

“If we follow,” Yan said, “we can strike the scrolls.”

Ren’s stomach turned.

Strike.

A clean word for killing.

If they struck, the Compact would finally have its story.

Bandits.

Outlaws.

Questioners with knives.

If they did not strike, the column would roll over clinics, shrines, and villages and call it cleansing.

Ren watched the last rank pass the gate.

At the column’s center, lacquer cases rode on a cart, guarded as if they contained a saint’s bones.

Ren knew what they contained.

Names.

And the tool that ate them.

She exhaled.

“We shadow,” she said.

Yan’s eyes sharpened.

“Not strike?”

Ren shook her head once.

“Not yet,” she said. “First we learn how they move. Where they sleep. Where they store the scrolls.”

Yan’s jaw clenched.

“And if they hurt people before we’re ready?”

Ren looked at the street.

At the mouths.

At the hunger.

At the white cloth walking away with authority.

“Then we do what we’ve been doing,” she said.

Yan’s gaze flicked to her pouch.

“Catch the ones they knock down,” he said.

Ren did not answer.

Because the answer tasted like ash.

She watched the column disappear into the outer wards.

And felt, in the quiet behind her ribs, the city’s language changing again.

Not into questions.

Into marching.

## Notes

- Continuity: The Marble Compact responds to internal instability by launching an outward “expedition” (invasion) to secure outer wards and grain routes; the White Column leaves the city carrying forms, scrolls, and Name-Eater tools under Captain Liang.
- Foreshadowing: The invasion reframes domestic dissent as external banditry; Ren and the vice leaders decide to shadow the column to locate Name-Eater stockpiles, setting up an ambush/turning point.
