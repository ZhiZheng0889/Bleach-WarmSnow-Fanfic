## Scene 1

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: The corridor between worlds
- **Goal**: Keep the stranded civilians moving long enough to reach a stable threshold

The corridor did not end.

It only changed its cruelty.

At first, it was distance—an unspooling hall that made every step feel like an argument. Then it became repetition. Corners that led to corners. Gray that looked identical until you stared long enough to notice the differences: a seam in the wall that wasn't there before, a patch of air that tasted metallic, a softness underfoot as if the ground had decided to stop pretending it was solid.

Ren walked anyway.

Behind him, the little group survived by turning themselves into a single creature with multiple hearts.

The cook—her hands still smelling faintly of salt and starch—kept one arm around the boy. She was not strong in the way soldiers were strong, but she had the kind of strength that came from feeding people for years: practical, stubborn, contemptuous of drama.

The runner stayed at the back, eyes sharp, neck loose, shoulders ready. She had been fast once, Ren guessed. She moved like someone whose body still remembered speed.

Ren did not ask their names.

Names were hooks.

And the corridor liked hooks.

“How far?” the cook asked, her voice quiet like a candle in wind.

Ren listened to the corridor for an answer.

It gave him nothing.

“Far enough,” he said.

The boy made a small sound—a hiccup that wanted to be a sob but didn't have the energy.

Ren slowed.

He could not afford to be kind in ways that stopped motion. Kindness here had to be shaped like forward momentum.

He crouched so his eyes were level with the boy's.

“Can you walk?” Ren asked.

The boy stared at Ren's mouth as if learning how to read answers on lips.

He nodded, then shook his head.

The cook tightened her grip.

“He can,” she said too quickly, like she was trying to convince the corridor as much as Ren.

The runner looked past them, down the gray.

“Do you know where you’re going?” she asked.

Ren hated the honesty the question demanded.

He was not a guide.

He was a person who had not fallen all the way.

He stood up.

“I know what we’re looking for,” he said.

The runner snorted, but it wasn’t unkind.

“A door,” she said.

Ren nodded.

He did not say the rest.

Not a door someone else built.

One he would have to convince into existence.

They walked.

Minutes stretched. Hours flattened. The corridor stole the sense of time the way it stole the sense of direction. Ren found himself watching the smallest measurements: the change in the boy’s breathing, the cook’s grip shifting from protective to painful, the runner’s footfalls starting to drag.

Ren did not look back too often.

If he looked back too often, the corridor would learn what mattered.

If the corridor learned what mattered, it would touch it.

And the corridor’s touch was always wrong.

The gray ahead shivered.

Ren stopped so sharply the runner nearly ran into him.

“What?” she hissed.

Ren lifted a hand.

Not a command.

A warning.

The corridor had shifted again.

Not into color.

Into definition.

He felt it before he saw it: pressure in his teeth, a faint ringing behind his eyes, the way his thoughts suddenly sounded closer, as if his mind had moved into a smaller room.

There was a seam.

At the seam hung something like a door.

Not wood.

Not stone.

An absence shaped like entry.

It did not have a handle.

It did not have a lock.

It did not even have the courtesy of being fully there.

The cook sucked in a breath.

The boy whispered, “Is that home?”

Ren swallowed.

The worst thing about the door was that it promised relief.

Promises were dangerous.

“It’s a threshold,” Ren said. He tried to make the words steady. “We don’t know which side.”

The runner stepped beside him, close enough that Ren could feel the heat of her skin.

“Choices are for people with safety,” she murmured.

Ren glanced at the cook, at the boy’s slack face, at the runner’s clenched jaw.

Then back at the absence.

Safety was the point.

Safety was also the bait.

Ren raised his hand.

The seam reacted.

Not opening.

Listening.

Ren had expected resistance—an argument, a punishment, a mockery.

Instead, it waited.

So he did the only thing he could do.

He spoke truth into a place made of lie.

“I’m not asking for permission,” Ren said. His voice sounded thin in the gray, but it carried. “I’m asking for passage.”

The seam tightened.

The corridor behind them went very still.

Ren felt the hairs on his arms rise.

He realized with a sick clarity that the corridor was not empty.

It was attention.

Ren kept his hand raised.

He did not bargain.

He did not promise.

He did not offer sacrifice.

He simply stayed.

Then, like a held breath released, the absence widened.

Wind came through.

Real wind.

It smelled like smoke and rain and something sharp—ash.

The cook started crying without sound.

The boy let out a sob so sudden it seemed to surprise his own body.

The runner exhaled hard.

Ren didn’t move.

He watched the opening for a trap.

He watched for a hand.

He watched for a hook.

Somewhere beyond the wind, a bell rang once.

Not in the corridor.

On the other side.

As if warning someone that a new kind of problem had learned their name.

“Go,” Ren said.

The cook hesitated.

Ren’s voice sharpened.

“Now.”

The cook moved, pulling the boy with her.

The runner went last, eyes on Ren.

“You first,” she said.

Ren shook his head.

“I go after,” he replied.

“That’s stupid,” she said.

Ren almost smiled.

“It’s responsibility,” he said, and stepped through behind them.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: A ruined street at the edge of a court district
- **Goal**: Keep the group alive long enough to be seen as people, not “incidents”

They spilled out like survivors escaping a story.

Stone underfoot.

Sky overhead.

Air that belonged to a world that pretended it was stable.

Ren’s knees nearly buckled with the relief of physics.

The street they landed in was not gentle.

Cracked stone.

Walls painted with fresh slogans over older prayers.

Smoke that clung to the throat.

And a sound in the distance—the constant, uneven roar of too many voices pressed into one place.

The cook gripped the boy’s shoulders.

“Stay with me,” she whispered.

The boy stared at the sky like he didn't trust it to remain.

Ren turned back, half-expecting the seam to still be open.

It was not.

The air was thick and ordinary.

The corridor had closed behind them like a mouth that had finished tasting.

The runner followed Ren’s gaze.

“It’s gone,” she said.

Ren nodded.

He felt it anyway.

Not open.

But present.

Like a bruise beneath skin.

“We move,” Ren said.

The cook’s eyes were red.

“Where?” she asked.

Ren listened.

The noise from the square pulled at him like gravity.

“Toward people,” he said.

The runner made a face.

“People are the problem,” she muttered.

Ren didn’t disagree.

But people were also the only thing that could be asked for help without paying a corridor.

They made their way down the street.

At the corner, Ren saw it.

White marble.

A basin in a square, bright and stubborn as myth.

Steps leading up.

Guards.

Crowds that wanted something and did not agree on what.

Ren recognized the shape of power even without knowing the names.

A stage.

The cook froze.

“Are we safe?” she asked.

Ren watched a uniformed man raise his voice. Watched a crowd refuse to become quiet.

Safe was not a place.

Safe was a negotiation.

“Not yet,” Ren said. “But we’re here.”

The runner exhaled.

“So what now?” she asked.

Ren looked down at his hands.

They were shaking.

Not from fear.

From the knowledge that he had created a way between worlds.

Doors did not stay private.

He had brought three people out of nowhere.

That meant he had made a proof.

Proofs were used.

Ren lifted his head.

“Now,” he said, “we find whoever decides who gets to breathe.”

## Notes

- Continuity: Bridges the corridor sequence into the political/public-space aftermath in Death Stage 02.
- Foreshadowing: The door becomes a contested object; everyone will want it to belong to them.
