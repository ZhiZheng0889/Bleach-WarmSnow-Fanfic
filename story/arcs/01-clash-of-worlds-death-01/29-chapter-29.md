## Scene 1

- **POV**: A Cinderbound quartermaster
- **Location**: Gate district warehouses
- **Goal**: Keep the push alive; turn street victories into sustained advance without starving the crowd

Winning a street was easy.

Feeding a street was hard.

The quartermaster stood among sacks of grain and felt the weight of victory.

Not pride.

Weight.

A runner reported.

“Inner cordon holds,” he said.

The quartermaster nodded.

“Holds,” he repeated.

Holding again.

The Compact loved holding.

Holding was how you pretended not to be losing.

The runner continued.

“Crowds are taking bread,” he said. “Some are grateful. Some are afraid.”

The quartermaster’s mouth tightened.

Gratitude was dangerous.

Gratitude wanted a ruler.

They were not here to be crowned.

They were here to keep pressure.

He looked at the sacks.

If the Cinderbound distributed bread, they became the new ration point.

If they became the new ration point, they became the new Compact.

The quartermaster exhaled.

“Don’t distribute,” he said.

The runner blinked.

“But they’re hungry,” he protested.

The quartermaster’s gaze stayed steady.

“Let them take,” he said.

Take.

Not receive.

Not be granted.

Take.

Taking was a habit that did not require permission.

A second runner arrived.

“Marshal wants to push the cordon tonight,” she said.

The quartermaster’s stomach tightened.

“Continuous victory,” he murmured.

Continuous victory ate supplies.

It ate sleep.

It ate discipline.

It also ate the enemy’s morale.

The quartermaster nodded.

“Tell him: yes,” he said.

Then, quieter:

“And tell him: don’t get trapped inside marble.”

The runner frowned.

“Inside marble?”

The quartermaster looked toward the palace district.

White walls.

Clean geometry.

A place built to make invaders feel small.

“Marble is a story,” he said. “If we fight on their stage, we become part of their script.”

The runner swallowed.

“And if we don’t push?”

The quartermaster’s voice was flat.

“Then we stop being victory,” he said.

Victory was a habit too.

Once the city tasted it, it would demand it.

Demand was another way a court was born.

He hated that.

He hated that he could feel the loop trying to close.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Captain Liang
- **Location**: Inner cordon patrol corridor
- **Goal**: Turn “all talk” into something that can stop a blade; improvise combat out of bureaucracy

Captain Liang walked the inner cordon corridor and listened to the court’s heartbeat.

It was not drums.

It was paper.

Clerks running.

Forms rustling.

Seals stamping.

A city trying to defend itself with administration.

A priest approached with a folded decree.

“Emergency authority,” the priest said.

Liang took it.

It granted patrols the right to demand surnames on sight.

To detain anyone who hesitated.

To mark wrists.

To seize ash.

Liang’s stomach turned.

“This will make them hate us,” he said.

The priest’s smile was thin.

“They already do,” he replied.

Liang exhaled.

Hatred was not the problem.

Hatred could be endured.

The problem was that hatred did not stop a knife.

Liang looked at the inner cordon gate.

A simple barrier.

A hinge in the city’s body.

He turned to his lieutenants.

“We don’t win by fighting,” he said.

A lieutenant blinked.

“Then how?”

Liang’s voice was tight.

“We win by denying,” he said.

Denying food.

Denying movement.

Denying names.

He hated the sentence as he spoke it.

Because he knew who paid the denial.

Not Lady Gao.

Not the priests.

Not the clerks.

The mouths.

He looked at the patrol roster.

Half of his people were exhausted.

None of them had real combat power.

They were being asked to stand against fire with paperwork.

Liang swallowed.

Then he did the only thing an officer could do when he had no steel.

He made a rule.

“Any breach attempt,” he said, “we fall back in layers. We never let them take a clean victory. We make them walk through doors we can close behind them.”

A lieutenant’s eyes widened.

“That’s… house fighting,” he said.

Liang nodded.

House fighting.

The kind of combat you used when you were weak.

The kind where architecture became your weapon.

The kind where the city itself did the fighting.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Lady Qiu Ren
- **Location**: A collapsed audit office near the cordon
- **Goal**: Exploit the chaos to destroy audit records; reduce the Compact’s ability to target small mouths

Ren did not love destruction.

She loved subtraction.

Taking away the enemy’s ability to count.

The audit office had been abandoned in the retreat.

Clipboards.

Forms.

Lists of names with marks beside them.

Inventory of breath.

Ren’s stomach turned.

This is how the Compact killed.

Quietly.

By deciding who was deprioritized.

Ren stepped inside and lit a small flame.

Not a Cinderbound blaze.

A careful one.

Just enough to eat paper.

Yan watched the door, blade ready.

“We’re burning evidence,” he whispered.

Ren nodded.

“We’re uncounting people,” she replied.

The papers curled.

Ink blackened.

A list became ash.

Ren exhaled.

She felt no triumph.

Only relief.

A patrol boot thudded outside.

Ren froze.

A clerk’s voice.

“Anyone in there?”

Ren’s throat tightened.

Yan’s hand moved.

Ren caught his wrist.

“No,” she breathed.

Yan’s eyes flashed.

“They’ll catch us,” he hissed.

Ren’s voice was low.

“Then be boring,” she said.

Boring meant: no blood.

No story.

No martyr.

The clerk shoved the door.

It creaked.

Smoke drifted out.

Ren stepped forward.

Her face calm.

Her hands stained with ash like a laundress.

“We were cleaning,” she lied.

The clerk’s eyes narrowed.

“Cleaning what?”

Ren lifted a rag.

“Spilled ink,” she said.

The clerk hesitated.

Hesitation was a crack.

Ren pushed.

“You should go,” she said softly. “The Cinderbound are near.”

Fear crossed the clerk’s face.

He stepped back.

Good.

Fear could be used.

Ren closed the door.

Yan exhaled.

Ren looked at the ashes.

One office.

One list.

A tiny victory.

Outside, the Cinderbound were stacking larger victories like firewood.

The nobles had no combat power.

So they fought with lists.

Ren would burn the lists.

And pray that would matter.

## Notes

- Continuity: Cinderbound victories create a logistics problem; inside the inner cordon, Liang shifts to layered, architecture-based defense; Ren burns audit records to reduce the Compact’s ability to target civilians.
- Foreshadowing: The war becomes about who can feed, count, and deny—victory versus governance; the next push will test whether combat power can break the palace geometry or gets trapped by it.
