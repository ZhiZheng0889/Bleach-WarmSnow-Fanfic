- **Relationships / allegiances**:

## Scene 1

- **POV**: Lady Gao Yue
- **Location**: The court’s inner colonnade, where marble sweats
- **Goal**: Preserve Compact legitimacy by claiming the crisis; avoid admitting the court can’t protect anyone

The marble was sweating.

Not moisture.

Meaning.

The court felt wrong.

Like a mouth pretending to be a face.

Lady Gao Yue walked the colonnade with measured steps.

Behind her, clerks carried new proclamations.

The ink kept lifting.

They had started pinning the pages to boards with nails.

Nails still obeyed.

For now.

A captain approached, pale.

“Another breach in the lower wards,” he said.

Lady Gao Yue did not show fear.

“How many?” she asked.

The captain swallowed.

“Four mouths,” he whispered. “People forget their own children when they stand too close.”

Lady Gao Yue’s hands tightened.

Forgetting was ungovernable.

If people could not remember, they could not obey.

If they could not obey, the Compact was nothing but banners and bone.

A clerk stammered.

“Lady, the crowds are saying the court is cursed.”

Lady Gao Yue’s eyes sharpened.

“Cursed is a story,” she replied. “Stories can be redirected.”

She turned.

“Announce that the Compact has always guarded the boundary,” she said.

The captain blinked.

“We—haven’t,” he said.

Lady Gao Yue’s smile was thin.

“Then start,” she replied.

A tremor ran through the colonnade.

A hairline crack appeared in a pillar.

Not from weight.

From pressure.

The court was not being attacked.

It was being outgrown.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: A Cinderbound marshal
- **Location**: The lower wards, at the edge of a widening seam
- **Goal**: Contain the mouths; decide whether to accept a temporary truce with the Compact

The air tasted like cold metal.

The lower wards were crowded with smoke and prayers that had forgotten their gods.

A mouth hovered above a collapsed house.

It opened and closed slowly.

Chewing the concept of shelter.

The marshal’s fighters ringed it with salt lines, broken tiles, and the sharp refusal of their bodies.

The mouth pressed.

The salt hissed.

The boundary held.

Barely.

A runner arrived from the court.

White cloth around his arm.

Not a flag.

A signal.

“Lady Gao Yue offers truce,” he said.

The marshal’s laugh was short.

“Truce?”

The runner nodded.

“Against the breaches,” he clarified. “She says this is not faction business.”

The marshal stared at the mouth.

It did not care about banners.

It did not care about courts.

It cared about emptiness.

He spit onto the dirt.

“This is still faction business,” he said. “Because she’ll use it.”

The runner flinched.

“Then what do we do?”

The marshal looked back at his fighters.

Tired.

Hungry.

Still refusing to become rulers.

He felt something like admiration for them.

Then he crushed it.

Admiration was how you stopped seeing costs.

He exhaled.

“We do it anyway,” he said.

The runner stared.

“Why?”

The marshal’s voice went quiet.

“Because the city doesn’t deserve to be eaten to prove a point,” he said.

He lifted his hand.

“Tell Gao Yue: we’ll hold the seams for one night,” he said. “No proclamations. No crowns.”

The runner nodded and ran.

The marshal looked at the mouth again.

“One night,” he muttered.

He did not believe in one nights.

But he believed in buying time.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: The Spirit King
- **Location**: Above the city, where the world’s single roof begins to buckle
- **Goal**: Watch the first true cooperation; realize time has run out for a single-world solution

They made a truce.

Not out of wisdom.

Out of terror.

Terror was honest.

He watched Compact enforcers stand beside Cinderbound fighters.

Watched clerks carry salt.

Watched a noblewoman hold a lantern while a street cook poured broth into the dark to make the dark flinch.

For a moment, the city became a single hand.

Not a ruling hand.

A holding hand.

It steadied the seam.

But steadiness was not repair.

The world was still one piece.

One roof.

One river.

The pressure did not vanish.

It searched for the next weak place.

He felt it.

A bulge.

A groan.

The hungry realm was not content with cracks.

It wanted a door.

He closed his eyes.

He could not keep the roof intact without turning the roof into a prison.

And prisons eventually broke too.

He opened his eyes.

The first clash between factions was ending.

Not with victory.

With a new enemy forcing a new shape.

He made the decision fully now.

Not yet action.

But commitment.

The world would be divided.

Not because he wanted separation.

Because he wanted containment.

## Notes

- Continuity: Gao Yue attempts to claim the breaches as Compact domain; the Cinderbound marshal accepts a one-night truce to hold the seams, refusing propaganda and crowns.
- Foreshadowing: The Spirit King commits internally to a structural solution—division of the world—to prevent the hungry realm from becoming a permanent door.
