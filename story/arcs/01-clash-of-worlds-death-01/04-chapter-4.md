## Scene 1

- **POV**: The First Smith
- **Location**: A seam-worksite (black iron scaffolds kissing white stone)
- **Goal**: Take what must be taken before history hardens it into “forbidden”

The seam had learned manners.

It no longer screamed.

It had been walled, named, scheduled.

Even the warm snow fell politely now—thin flakes that drifted like paperwork.

The First Smith stood on a scaffold of chain and slag and watched the white side through a slit that wasn’t meant to exist.

Beyond it: stone as clean as denial.

A palace that had not yet decided whether it was a sanctuary or a vault.

He could feel it in his teeth.

The shard in his sleeve answered like a tuning fork.

“You’re sure?” asked the woman beside him.

She wore no house colors. No crest.

Just soot and a simple Path-mark burned into her collarbone: a guild sign, not a family brand.

The First Smith nodded.

“I’m not sure,” he said. “I’m certain.

There’s a difference.”

She didn’t laugh. That meant she understood him.

Below them, guild crews tightened bolts and checked seals.

Not soldiers.

Workers who could fight if forced.

That was the design.

In the commune, anyone who demanded exemption was treated like a fire hazard.

A runner approached, breath steaming.

“Struts are holding,” he reported. “Heat leak is within tolerance. White pressure spikes whenever we anchor.”

“Of course it does,” the First Smith said.

He stared at the palace.

At the place where names lived.

At the place where the Spirit King’s future-sight had poured itself into architecture.

The First Smith could predict the argument waiting there.

*If you let one breach happen, you teach the world that breaches are possible.*

And he could predict the other one.

*If you declare something forbidden, you teach people it is valuable.*

He ran his thumb along the edge of the anvil’s strap.

“I’m not stealing,” he said, mostly to himself. “I’m reclaiming.

A world doesn’t get to shed pieces and then call them sacred once someone else learns how to use them.”

The woman beside him leaned closer.

“Is this about the forge,” she asked, “or about him?”

The First Smith’s answer came too fast.

“It’s about survival.”

Then, after a pause he didn’t want to admit he needed:

“And it’s about him.”

He hated that.

Friendship was the most expensive resource.

It made you hesitate.

Hesitation got people killed.

He forced his eyes back to the practical.

The seamwork crew lowered a hook of black metal into the slit.

The hook did not scrape.

It *resisted*.

White stone protested contact the way clean hands protest ash.

Somewhere in the palace, a bell rang.

Not an alarm.

A notification.

The First Smith smiled.

“See?” he murmured. “Even their emergencies have etiquette.”

He raised his hand.

“Pull,” he said.

The hook caught.

Something bright flared.

For a heartbeat, the slit widened.

And the First Smith saw the inside of the white side the way you see a future in a knife’s reflection.

Not a prophecy.

A warning.

He felt the shard in his sleeve grow heavier.

As if it recognized its own origin.

“Careful,” the woman said.

The First Smith’s voice went flat.

“I am careful,” he replied.

Then, softer—almost kind:

“I’m just not naive.”

## Scene 2

- **POV**: The Spirit King
- **Location**: The palace hall
- **Goal**: Stop escalation without becoming the tyrant his future keeps offering

The palace had been built to make violence feel small.

High ceilings.

Long corridors.

Distance that turned shouting into embarrassment.

It worked on most people.

It did not work on dread.

The Spirit King stood in the hall with his hands empty and his attention full.

He had felt the seam flex.

He had felt it the way a body feels a splinter.

A tiny wrongness.

A small insistence that something foreign was trying to become real.

The nobles arrived in a semicircle.

They didn’t run.

They *convened*.

Even fear was expected to be polite.

“My king,” one began, and the Spirit King felt the future tighten around that phrase.

He could see the branch where a king becomes a weapon.

He could see the branch where refusing to be a weapon becomes treason.

He could see the branch where trying to hold both positions turns you into a statue.

“Speak,” he said.

“The seam is disturbed,” the noble continued. “A black incursion. It must be answered decisively.”

Decisively.

The word meant different things depending on whether you were hungry.

The Spirit King looked past the speaker, through the palace walls, to the seam.

He could see the First Smith there.

Not directly.

Not like a spy.

Like a future remembers its cause.

He saw the First Smith’s hands.

He saw the hook.

He saw a bright flare.

He saw ten thousand outcomes bloom like frost patterns on glass.

In half of them, the court demanded war.

In half of them, the commune answered.

In all of them, people died who had never heard either founder speak.

The Spirit King swallowed.

He could see the future.

He could not make it stop being true.

Someone had told him once—he could not remember if it was a person or merely a feeling that had become wisdom—that power without innocence becomes cruelty.

He had held onto innocence like a lantern.

Sometimes he worried it was only another kind of blindness.

“What was taken?” he asked.

The nobles hesitated.

They did not like that question.

It implied something had value.

It implied something was worth stealing.

“It was not taken yet,” the noble said carefully. “But the attempt itself is an insult.

A breach teaches the world that walls can be questioned.”

Yes, the Spirit King thought.

That is exactly why walls exist.

So they can be questioned.

So they can be answered.

So the answer can become law.

He looked at the nobles’ faces.

They wanted a clean, simple story.

Black invaders.

White defenders.

Order versus chaos.

If he gave them that story, it would hold the court together.

It would also train the court to crave more of it.

Victory is addictive.

Righteousness even more so.

He turned away from them.

Toward the seam.

Toward the place where warm snow fell like memory.

He spoke as if addressing the air.

“Friend,” he said.

He felt futures tremble.

Some brightened.

Some shattered.

Then he said the other word.

“Nemesis.”

The nobles stiffened.

They did not like uncertainty.

They did not like a king who spoke to ghosts.

The Spirit King lifted his hand.

Not a command.

A pause.

“No armies,” he said. “Not yet.

If I answer a hook with a sword, I teach both worlds what language they must speak.”

The noble’s mouth tightened.

“My king—”

The Spirit King’s gaze snapped back.

Not angry.

Just… present.

“You want decisiveness,” he said, and his voice remained gentle enough to be terrifying.

“Here it is.

Seal the palace vaults.

Strengthen the seam.

Send no banners.

Send me.”

The hall went quiet.

Someone’s breath caught.

The Spirit King could see the futures where he went alone.

He could also see the futures where he didn’t.

In the futures where he didn’t, a war began that never ended.

So he chose.

Not the least blood today.

The least blood forever.

And he walked toward the seam.

## Notes
- Continuity: This chapter sets up the “Ancient clash” era—first serious attempt to siphon palace/soul-scrap.
- Theme: Court wants clean war narratives; commune wants survival assets; the founders’ friendship makes escalation both harder and more inevitable.
