## Scene 1

- **POV**: Captain Liang
- **Location**: Gate district barricades
- **Goal**: Hold the city’s mouth; stop the Cinderbound from turning pushback into breach

The Compact had built its city like a sentence.

Subjects.

Verbs.

Clauses.

Everything in order.

Everything legible.

Now the sentence was being shouted over.

Captain Liang stood behind a barricade made of wagons and shields and the nervous bodies of men who had never thought of themselves as soldiers.

They were peacekeepers.

They were auditors.

They were the people who stood beside a clipboard and made hunger feel deserved.

Now they held spears.

Spears did not make them warriors.

Spears only made their fear pointy.

A clerk crouched beside Liang, face pale.

“Captain,” the clerk whispered, “the Audit lines are breaking.”

Liang’s jaw tightened.

“Then stop asking questions,” Liang snapped.

The clerk flinched.

“But Lady Gao—”

Liang cut him off.

“Lady Gao is not standing here,” Liang said.

He did not mean it as insult.

He meant it as physics.

Paper could not stop a charging body.

A priest approached, basin charm bouncing at his belt.

“The Compact’s authority holds,” the priest said.

Liang looked at him.

Authority did not stop arrows.

Authority did not stop fire.

Authority did not stop a knife in the dark.

“What holds is the barricade,” Liang said.

The priest’s mouth tightened.

“We have the Name-Eater,” the priest whispered.

Liang’s stomach turned.

The Name-Eater was missing.

Or worse, it was in the wrong hands.

“We have scrolls,” Liang corrected.

The priest blinked.

Liang continued.

“And scrolls are not spears,” he said.

A shout rose from the street.

Not a chant.

Not a prayer.

A warning.

“They’re coming!”

Liang’s spine stiffened.

He peered over the wagon line.

At the far end of the gate district, smoke curled like a question mark.

Not thick.

Not dramatic.

The kind that meant someone had lit something on purpose.

Then he saw movement.

Dark figures.

Loose formation.

Not disciplined like soldiers.

Disciplined like people who had survived without forms.

Cinderbound.

They moved between buildings as if the streets belonged to them.

Because, in a way, they did.

They understood fear.

Not as a policy.

As a material.

A runner beside Liang swallowed.

“Captain,” the runner whispered, “they’re not stopping to negotiate.”

Liang almost laughed.

Of course they weren’t.

Negotiation belonged to people who could afford time.

The Compact’s nobles were all talk.

All explanation.

All frame.

The Cinderbound had power.

Actual combat power.

The kind that turned a street into an argument you couldn’t win with paperwork.

Liang raised his hand.

“Archers,” he ordered.

A peacekeeper blinked.

“We don’t have archers,” she said.

Liang’s jaw clenched.

Of course they didn’t.

The Compact had invested in clerks.

In forms.

In seals.

In the kind of control you could stamp.

Not in bodies trained to kill.

Liang looked at the barricade.

At the shaking hands.

At the thin line of steel pretending to be a wall.

He felt a cold certainty.

They were about to be tested.

Not by rhetoric.

By impact.

The first Cinderbound reached the mouth of the street.

He did not shout.

He did not chant.

He sprinted.

A second followed.

Then a third.

Liang’s throat tightened.

They weren’t trying to intimidate.

They were trying to *win*.

Liang shouted.

“Hold!”

Peacekeepers braced.

Spears leveled.

The barricade waited.

And then the Cinderbound hit.

Not like a wave.

Like a hammer.

A spear snapped.

A wagon lurched.

A peacekeeper screamed.

Liang felt the line buckle.

He swung his own spear and felt it connect with something solid.

A shoulder.

A rib.

The Cinderbound fighter grunted, not slowed.

Not impressed.

He drove forward.

Liang’s arms shook.

He understood, with brutal clarity, the difference between people trained to enforce and people trained to fight.

The Compact had built a city out of talk.

Now talk was being trampled.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Lady Gao Yue
- **Location**: The white court balcony
- **Goal**: Keep the court from panicking; translate battlefield loss into renewed legitimacy

Lady Gao Yue watched the smoke from the gate district and felt the city’s mouth bleeding.

A court’s first impulse was to deny blood.

Her second impulse was to call it a sacrifice.

She stood on the balcony in perfect white, with priests behind her and banners above her, and listened to the reports climb the stairs.

“Breach attempt,” a courier panted.

The courier’s hands shook.

Hands that had never signed a form in their lives.

Hands that now carried bad news.

Lady Gao Yue’s voice was calm.

“Containment?” she asked.

The courier swallowed.

“Captain Liang is holding,” he said.

Holding.

The word again.

Holding meant: losing slowly.

A priest leaned forward.

“We must announce a decree,” he said.

Lady Gao Yue looked at him.

Decrees were for people who believed words made walls.

Words did make walls.

But walls did not stop fire.

“We will announce,” she said.

The priest exhaled with relief.

“What?” he asked.

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze stayed on the smoke.

“We will announce that the city is united,” she said.

The councilwoman beside her flinched.

“It isn’t,” she whispered.

Lady Gao Yue did not look at her.

“Then we will announce it harder,” she replied.

She turned to a clerk.

“Prepare the proclamation,” she said.

The clerk’s pen shook.

Lady Gao Yue spoke like she was signing air.

“By order of the Marble Compact: hostile forces have violated the peace of our streets. The Compact will protect every compliant citizen.”

Compliant.

Always that word.

The councilwoman’s voice was tight.

“And the noncompliant?” she asked.

Lady Gao Yue smiled thinly.

“They will be invited to become compliant,” she said.

Invitation.

A polite word for coercion.

A second courier arrived.

His face was gray.

“Lady,” he gasped, “they’re winning.”

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze sharpened.

“Where?”

“Everywhere they touch,” the courier whispered.

Lady Gao Yue’s throat tightened.

That was the definition of combat power.

The nobles had never needed it.

They had always hired it.

Or hidden behind someone else’s steel.

Now there was no one else.

Only her.

Only marble.

Only talk.

She turned back toward the court interior.

“Activate the inner cordon,” she said.

The priest blinked.

“That will—”

“It will seal the palace district,” Lady Gao Yue finished.

Seal.

A word that sounded protective.

A word that meant abandonment.

The councilwoman inhaled.

“You’re cutting off the gate district,” she said.

Lady Gao Yue did not deny it.

“If the mouth is bleeding,” she said softly, “you do not feed it more blood.”

The councilwoman stared.

Lady Gao Yue’s voice did not rise.

“We keep the axis,” she said.

Axis.

If she lost the axis, she lost everything.

She felt the court’s panic begin to move like a rumor.

She crushed it with her posture.

No shaking.

No flinching.

No admission.

If the nobles were all talk, then she would make talk into armor.

Even if she had to weld it from lies.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Lady Qiu Ren
- **Location**: Back alleys behind the barricades
- **Goal**: Keep civilians alive as the Compact’s front line breaks; prevent the Cinderbound from owning the rescue

Ren moved through the alleys like a rumor with hands.

She carried ash paste.

She carried stamps.

She carried the habit.

The barricade ahead buckled.

She heard the snap of wood.

The scream.

The sudden silence when a throat learned fear too fast.

Yan was beside her, blade out, eyes hard.

“They’re breaking through,” he said.

Ren nodded.

“I know,” she replied.

A woman stumbled out of a doorway with a child in her arms.

The child’s face was gray.

Smoke.

Panic.

Ren grabbed the woman’s elbow.

“Down this way,” she snapped.

The woman’s eyes were wild.

“Where is safe?” she gasped.

Ren swallowed.

Safe was a court word.

There was only less lethal.

“Not the street,” Ren said.

A Cinderbound fighter appeared at the alley mouth.

Blood on his sleeve.

Not his.

He saw Ren and smiled.

“Lady Qiu,” he called.

Her name again.

Always the hook.

Ren’s stomach tightened.

He looked past her at the civilians.

“Bring them,” he said warmly. “We’ll protect them.”

Protection.

The sweet word.

The trap.

Ren’s jaw clenched.

“We’re already protecting them,” she said.

The fighter’s smile widened.

“With ash?” he asked.

“With habits,” Ren replied.

The fighter laughed.

“Habits don’t stop spears,” he said.

Ren’s voice was flat.

“Neither do forms,” she said.

The fighter’s eyes glittered.

“Exactly,” he replied.

He stepped aside.

He did not block the alley.

He did not threaten.

He offered.

That was worse.

Because offered protection was how you bought ownership without admitting it.

Ren grabbed the woman and pushed her deeper into the alley.

“Keep moving,” she hissed.

Yan’s blade lifted.

Ren caught his wrist.

“No,” she breathed.

Yan’s eyes flashed.

“They’re right there,” he growled.

Ren’s throat tightened.

“And if you strike, the Compact will call you the reason the city burns,” she said.

Yan’s jaw clenched.

Ren forced herself to keep her voice steady.

“We keep people alive,” she said. “We do not become the story.”

Behind them, the barricade finally broke.

The sound was a crack like a sentence snapping.

Ren flinched anyway.

Not fear.

Grief.

Because she knew what came next.

When a court lost the street, it tightened the palace.

And everyone outside the palace became expendable.

The Cinderbound surged forward.

Continuous victory.

Impact after impact.

The nobles could talk.

The Cinderbound could win.

Ren moved faster.

If she couldn’t stop victory, she would at least steal some bodies back from it.

## Notes

- Continuity: The Cinderbound push into the gate district with decisive combat power; the Compact’s forces (trained for enforcement, not war) buckle, and Lady Gao Yue responds by sealing the inner cordon around the palace district.
- Foreshadowing: The Cinderbound’s continuous wins set up a rapid advance toward the court; Ren focuses on rescue and decentralization, while Gao Yue converts battlefield loss into tighter internal legitimacy.
