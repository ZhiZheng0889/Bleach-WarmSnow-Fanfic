## Scene 1

- **POV**: The Furnace Matron
- **Location**: Kiln-house, receiving the stolen case
- **Goal**: Decide whether to use the Name-Eater; keep the Cinderbound from becoming the next court

The lacquer case arrived like a coffin.

Carried carefully.

Not because the runners respected it.

Because it felt alive.

The Furnace Matron watched it set on the kiln-house table.

Ink seeped at the seam.

A counter-seal stamp bruised the lacquer.

Ash.

Salt.

Herbs.

The Matron’s gaze sharpened.

“Lady Qiu,” she murmured.

The marshal’s smile was thin.

“She touched it,” he said.

Ash-Recorder leaned in, nostrils flaring.

“Friction,” he whispered.

The marshal’s mouth tightened.

“She ruined it,” he said.

The Furnace Matron did not agree.

She tapped the stamped seam with one knuckle.

The case shuddered.

Ink rippled.

It wanted.

A tool that wanted was a tool that could be led.

“A contaminated blade still cuts,” she said.

The marshal’s eyes brightened.

“Then we use it,” he said.

Ash-Recorder’s pen scratched.

“Use it on whom?” he asked.

The marshal’s smile sharpened.

“On the Compact,” he said. “On their clerks. On their priests. On the people who made the city fear speaking.”

The Furnace Matron’s voice cooled.

“And on the hungry mother at a ration line?” she asked.

The marshal blinked.

“That’s not our target,” he said.

The Furnace Matron held his gaze.

“Tools do not respect your targets,” she said.

Ash-Recorder nodded.

“The Name-Eater eats names,” he said. “Names travel. Names slip.”

The marshal’s jaw clenched.

“Then we control it,” he said.

The Furnace Matron’s smile was thin.

“Like the Compact controls bread?” she asked.

The marshal flinched.

Silence.

The kiln-house listened.

The Matron stepped around the table.

She placed her palm near the lacquer seam.

Not touching.

Offering.

The case trembled.

Ink seeped.

It smelled like old paper and stolen breath.

The Furnace Matron withdrew.

“We do not use it,” she said.

The marshal’s eyes widened.

“We stole it to not use it?”

Ash-Recorder’s pen stopped.

The Furnace Matron’s gaze stayed steady.

“We stole it to prove they can lose it,” she said. “We stole it to show the city that relics bleed.”

The marshal’s mouth tightened.

“That’s not enough,” he said.

The Furnace Matron nodded.

“It might not be,” she agreed.

She looked at Ash-Recorder.

“Record this,” she said.

Ash-Recorder’s pen scratched.

The Furnace Matron continued.

“If we become a court, we become marble,” she said. “And marble can be burned.”

The marshal’s eyes narrowed.

“Then what are we?” he demanded.

The Furnace Matron’s voice stayed calm.

“We are pressure,” she said. “We are the city remembering it can say no.”

The marshal’s hands clenched.

“And Lady Qiu?” he asked.

The Furnace Matron’s gaze sharpened.

“She is friction,” she replied.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Lady Gao Yue
- **Location**: The white court, crisis response
- **Goal**: Convert the theft into justification for sweeping raids and deeper audits

The report arrived at dawn.

A lacquer case stolen.

Guards humiliated.

Patrol route compromised.

And worst of all:

A rumor that the relic had bled.

Rumors were the enemy.

Not because they were false.

Because they were mobile.

Lady Gao Yue listened to Captain Liang’s briefing.

His voice was controlled.

His eyes were not.

“They used smoke,” he said. “They used rooftops. They were organized.”

Lady Gao Yue nodded.

“Cinderbound,” she said.

Liang hesitated.

“Yes,” he admitted.

A priest slammed his fist.

“Bandits!” he spat.

Lady Gao Yue did not look at him.

“Names,” she said.

The priest blinked.

“What?”

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze stayed cold.

“You can call them bandits,” she said. “Or you can call them an army. The city will decide which word tastes truer.”

The priest’s mouth tightened.

Lady Gao Yue continued.

“We have lost a tool,” she said.

The councilwoman inhaled.

“And we will respond by tightening the net,” she said.

Lady Gao Yue nodded.

“Yes,” she replied.

No shame.

Only procedure.

She placed a new document on the table.

**THE COMPLIANCE SWEEP**

A week of raids.

Clinic inspections.

Rooftop patrols.

Mandatory Registry surnames.

Expanded Audit questions.

And a new addition:

An oath that permitted clerks to demand names in public spaces.

The councilwoman’s face went pale.

“That’s… dangerous,” she whispered.

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze did not soften.

“Danger is the currency,” she said. “We spend it or we lose it.”

Captain Liang’s jaw clenched.

“And the counter-seals?” he asked.

Lady Gao Yue’s eyes sharpened.

“We will treat them as sabotage,” she said.

The councilwoman’s mouth tightened.

“They are help,” she said.

Lady Gao Yue’s voice was flat.

“Help that is not counted is theft,” she replied.

She turned to the priest.

“You will preach,” she said.

The priest blinked.

“Preach what?”

Lady Gao Yue’s smile was thin.

“That the city is under invasion,” she said.

The priest’s eyes brightened.

“By fire,” he whispered.

Lady Gao Yue nodded.

“And by questioners,” she added.

Category.

Hook.

Coffin.

Liang inhaled.

“You’re merging them,” he said.

Lady Gao Yue met his gaze.

“Yes,” she replied.

If you could not win against two enemies, you made them one.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Lady Qiu Ren
- **Location**: Gate district rooftop seam
- **Goal**: Keep the counter-seal network from being wiped out in the Compliance Sweep

Ren read the sweep bulletin on a wall.

The ink was fresh.

The promises were old.

Safety.

Protection.

Compliance.

She felt Yan beside her, silent.

“They’re coming,” he said.

Ren nodded.

The Sweep meant raids.

Raids meant names.

Names meant the Name-Eater.

Even without the stolen case, the Compact had other scrolls.

Ren’s mouth was dry.

She had turned friction into a weapon last night.

Now she would pay.

Yan’s voice was tight.

“We should strike first,” he said.

Ren stared at the street.

She saw patrols forming.

Clerks with clipboards.

Priests rehearsing sermons.

The city tightening its own collar.

“We can’t out-raid them,” Ren said.

Yan’s jaw clenched.

“Then we run,” he spat.

Ren shook her head.

“We don’t run,” she said. “We scatter.”

Yan blinked.

Ren continued.

“No more central clinics,” she said. “No more visible lines. No more nodes.”

Yan’s eyes narrowed.

“That means fewer people get help,” he said.

Ren’s throat tightened.

“Yes,” she replied.

She hated that truth.

She hated that logistics were the true battlefield.

But she could not lie.

Not to Yan.

Not to herself.

“The Sweep is a net,” she said. “We become sand.”

Yan stared.

Ren’s voice lowered.

“And we teach everyone the recipe,” she said.

Yan’s eyes widened.

“Everyone?”

Ren nodded.

“If help belongs to everyone,” she said, “then the Compact can’t confiscate it from a single door.”

Yan’s mouth tightened.

“And the Cinderbound?” he asked.

Ren’s stomach turned.

Fire offering protection.

Protection offering ownership.

“They’ll try to sell bravery,” Ren said.

Yan’s eyes hardened.

“And we sell boredom,” he murmured.

Ren nodded.

Boredom.

Unmarketable survival.

The only habit that could outlast a sweep.

## Notes

- Continuity: The Cinderbound bring the stolen Name-Eater case to leadership, who choose not to deploy it (yet) to avoid becoming the next court; the Compact responds to the theft with a harsh Compliance Sweep merging “fire-bandits” and “questioners” into one enemy category.
- Foreshadowing: The Sweep forces Ren’s network to decentralize radically (sand instead of nodes) and pushes the Compact toward public name-demands; Cinderbound possession of the contaminated case remains a volatile wildcard.
