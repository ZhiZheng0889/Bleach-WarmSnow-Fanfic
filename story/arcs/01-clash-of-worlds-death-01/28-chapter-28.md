## Scene 1

- **POV**: Captain Liang
- **Location**: Gate district streets, retreating line
- **Goal**: Prevent a rout from becoming slaughter; keep any coherence as the Cinderbound advance

Retreat felt different when you had started the war.

It felt like the city itself rejecting you.

Captain Liang backed through the gate district, shouting orders that landed on men’s backs instead of their minds.

“Line!” he barked.

No line formed.

Peacekeepers ran.

Clerks clutched clipboards as if paper could stop a blade.

Liang’s jaw clenched.

All talk.

No steel.

The Compact had built power out of paperwork.

Now paperwork was confetti.

A Cinderbound fighter vaulted a fallen wagon and landed in the street like a verdict.

He moved with practiced violence.

Not rage.

Efficiency.

Liang thrust his spear.

The fighter parried with a short blade and kept coming.

Liang’s arms shook.

The fighter’s eyes were calm.

That calm was worse than hatred.

Hatred could be bargained with.

Calm meant the outcome had already been decided.

Liang stumbled back.

A peacekeeper screamed.

A clerk fell.

The street filled with smoke.

Liang tried to find a phrase that could hold people.

Not a chant.

A command.

“Hold the cordon!” he shouted.

The inner cordon.

The palace district line.

If that fell, the Compact’s axis would be exposed.

Liang could feel the city’s geometry tightening.

From open streets to funnels.

From funnels to chokepoints.

From chokepoints to gates.

The Compact was retreating into architecture.

And the Cinderbound were following with laughter.

A runner grabbed Liang’s sleeve.

“Captain,” the runner gasped, “they’re taking the ration points.”

Liang’s stomach dropped.

Ration points were not just food.

They were authority.

If the Cinderbound took bread, they would own the mouth.

Liang ripped his sleeve free.

“Fall back to the inner cordon,” he ordered.

The runner stared.

“And the gate district?”

Liang’s jaw clenched.

He did not answer.

Answering would make it real.

They abandoned the gate district.

Not with a proclamation.

With footsteps.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: A Cinderbound marshal
- **Location**: Gate district, captured ration point
- **Goal**: Turn victory into a lever; avoid becoming a “new Compact” while still taking ground

The ration point smelled like flour and fear.

The marshal stepped onto the platform where clerks had asked questions and made hunger feel like a moral exam.

A clipboard lay broken in the dirt.

Good.

He nudged it with his boot.

Paper had been a weapon.

Now it was trash.

A runner approached.

“Barricades broken,” the runner said. “Inner cordon next.”

The marshal nodded.

Continuous victory.

It felt like rolling downhill.

He looked at the crowd.

Hungry faces.

Suspicious eyes.

A city that had been trained to fear speech.

He raised his hands.

Not in blessing.

In demonstration.

“We don’t audit,” he called.

Murmurs.

The crowd did not cheer.

Cheering was dangerous.

Cheering made you visible.

He continued.

“We don’t ask you to be compliant,” he said.

More murmurs.

A woman clutched a child.

The child coughed.

The marshal’s smile softened.

“We ask you to remember,” he said.

Remember what?

Not doctrine.

A sensation.

That marble could be pushed.

That talk could be interrupted.

He pointed at a sack of grain.

“Eat,” he said.

The crowd hesitated.

They had learned that eating without permission was theft.

The marshal’s smile sharpened.

“Count us back,” he called.

A few mouths moved.

Not a chant.

A whisper.

The phrase had become bait.

He knew it.

He used it anyway.

Because victory needed a sentence.

A runner leaned close.

“Matron says: don’t become a court,” the runner whispered.

The marshal’s jaw tightened.

The Matron always said that.

As if you could occupy ration points and not become something.

He looked down at the sacks.

Bread.

Authority.

He exhaled.

“We take the cordon,” he said quietly. “Then we take their tools.”

Not their people.

Not their streets.

Their tools.

The lacquer cases.

The registry.

The ability to bind names.

If you broke the tool, you broke the Compact.

A crowd member whispered.

“They’ll come back,” she said.

The marshal’s smile was bright.

“Let them,” he replied.

Because the nobles were all talk.

And he had steel.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Lady Gao Yue
- **Location**: Inner cordon checkpoint
- **Goal**: Prevent panic at the palace line; use ritual to substitute for lost battlefield control

Lady Gao Yue stood at the inner cordon and watched the city collapse toward her.

Refugees.

Clerks.

Guards.

A river of bodies.

She did not comfort them.

Comfort was a luxury.

She offered structure.

A priest lifted a basin.

Not the public basin.

A smaller one.

Portable purity.

Lady Gao Yue spoke.

“Any who cross this line will be recorded,” she said.

A murmur.

Recorded meant safe.

Recorded meant owned.

The crowd surged anyway.

They chose ownership over fire.

Lady Gao Yue watched their faces.

Not with pity.

With inventory.

The Safety Audit had taught her what to look for.

A twitch at the forbidden phrase.

A pause at surname.

A glance toward ash.

Captain Liang arrived, uniform torn, eyes tired.

“The gate district is lost,” he said.

Lady Gao Yue’s throat tightened.

She did not show it.

“Then the gate falls inward,” she replied.

Liang stared.

Lady Gao Yue continued.

“We are not losing the city,” she said. “We are shrinking it.”

Liang’s mouth tightened.

“And everyone outside?” he asked.

Lady Gao Yue did not answer directly.

Answers created guilt.

She created policy instead.

“We will hold the palace district,” she said. “We will hold the registry hall. We will hold the remaining scrolls.”

Liang’s eyes flicked.

“And if they breach?”

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze stayed steady.

“Then we will make their victory expensive,” she said.

Not with steel.

With consequences.

With famine.

With marks.

With the kind of violence that paperwork could deliver quietly.

Outside the cordon, smoke rose.

Inside, marble cooled.

The Cinderbound were winning with bodies.

Lady Gao Yue would answer with systems.

Even if systems could not fight.

Systems could still *punish*.

## Notes

- Continuity: The Compact abandons the gate district and retreats to the inner cordon; the Cinderbound seize ration points and continue their advance, turning battlefield momentum into control over bread and movement.
- Foreshadowing: Gao Yue doubles down on ritualized control and shrinking territory, setting up a clash between Cinderbound combat power and Compact systemic punishment (marks, famine, registry binding).
