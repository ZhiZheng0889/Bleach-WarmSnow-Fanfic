- **Relationships / allegiances**:

## Scene 1

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: A corridor that feels like distance given form
- **Goal**: Find the people who fell between worlds; decide whether to become a bridge

Ren woke up standing.

That was the first wrong thing.

He should have been on the market stones.

He should have been holding a bowl.

He should have been listening to arguments.

Instead, he stood in a corridor.

Not a street.

Not a room.

A passage.

Gray walls that were not stone.

Air that was not air.

It smelled like the moment between inhaling and committing.

He took one step.

The corridor shivered.

Far away, he heard voices.

Not echoes.

People.

A child cried.

Ren’s stomach twisted.

“Hello?” he called.

His voice came back wrong.

Thin.

He moved faster.

The corridor stretched.

Distance here was malicious.

It did not want to be crossed.

At the corner, he found three figures huddled.

A cook.

A runner.

A boy with salt on his hands.

They stared at Ren like he was a verdict.

“Where are we?” the cook whispered.

Ren swallowed.

“I think we fell between,” he said.

The boy began to sob.

“I want my mother,” he said.

Ren knelt.

He did not promise.

Promises were crowns.

But he put his hands on the boy’s shoulders.

“We’ll walk,” he said. “We’ll find a door.”

The runner’s eyes were sharp.

“And if there isn’t one?” she asked.

Ren looked down the corridor.

He felt, in his bones, the new geometry.

Three worlds that wanted to stay apart.

A stability built on separation.

If anyone could cross, it would require someone to learn the rules of the passage.

A bridge.

Bridges became targets.

Ren exhaled.

“I’ll make one,” he said.

He hated the sound of it.

Because it sounded like a role.

And roles were the first step toward institutions.

But children were not a theory.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: A Cinderbound marshal
- **Location**: The living city, under a sky that no longer splits
- **Goal**: Accept the end of the first clash; decide what the Cinderbound become without an enemy within reach

The city smelled different.

Less ash.

More breath.

The mouths were gone.

Not defeated.

Removed.

The marshal walked the streets and tried to find the Compact.

He found ration points.

He found empty posts.

He found white banners hanging limp.

But he did not find Gao Yue.

Not because she had fled.

Because she was no longer in the same world.

A boundary ran through the city like a quiet verdict.

Some alleys ended in shimmering distance.

Some doors opened to nothing.

He watched a man try to cross.

The man stepped forward.

Then stopped.

As if his body refused to take the step.

The marshal approached.

“What did you feel?” he asked.

The man swallowed.

“Like my bones remembered a law,” he whispered.

The marshal nodded.

Law without a court.

That was new.

His lieutenant approached.

“So,” she said, voice low, “we won?”

The marshal stared at the boundary.

“No,” he said.

She frowned.

“Did we lose?”

The marshal’s voice was flat.

“We got interrupted,” he replied.

He looked at his fighters.

They had lived for pressure.

For pushing.

For proving the court could be hurt.

Now the court was unreachable.

The enemy was behind a rule.

He felt something like emptiness.

Not hunger.

Purpose-hunger.

He tightened his hands.

“Then we change,” he said.

His lieutenant stared.

“Into what?”

The marshal exhaled.

“Into people who build without crowns,” he said.

He did not know if it was possible.

But he knew the alternative.

Banditry.

Warlord.

Another court.

He had refused that once.

Now he would have to refuse it every day.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Lady Gao Yue
- **Location**: The dead-world court, where silence has weight
- **Goal**: Stabilize a new realm; turn the Compact into custodians rather than rulers

Silence here was heavy.

It settled on shoulders.

It filled halls.

It made footsteps sound like confession.

Lady Gao Yue watched the first arrival.

A pale figure drifting, confused.

Not dead as the living understood it.

A soul.

It looked around.

“Where…is my house?” it asked.

Lady Gao Yue’s clerk hesitated.

Lady Gao Yue stepped forward.

“Your house is not here,” she said.

The soul trembled.

“Then where am I?”

Lady Gao Yue did not soften.

Softness was how crowds formed.

Crowds became riots.

She needed process.

“You are in the second world,” she said. “The world that receives what the living cannot hold.”

The soul stared.

“That’s…death,” it whispered.

Lady Gao Yue nodded.

“Yes,” she said.

She did not call it punishment.

She did not call it mercy.

She called it logistics.

Because logistics could be managed.

A clerk leaned close.

“Lady,” he whispered, “if this is our domain now…then we will need laws.”

Lady Gao Yue’s eyes stayed on the arriving souls.

“Yes,” she said.

“And guardians,” the clerk added.

Lady Gao Yue exhaled.

Guardians.

An institution.

A structure.

Not the Compact as it had been.

But something new wearing its bones.

She looked toward the boundary.

Toward the living city she could not reach.

She felt, for the first time, an unfamiliar ache.

Not regret.

Constraint.

The world had limited her.

She had never forgiven limits.

She would not start now.

She straightened.

“Begin the intake,” she ordered.

A clerk lifted a ledger.

Ink stayed.

Names held.

Lady Gao Yue watched the first page fill.

And in the steadiness, she understood the Spirit King’s gift.

Not freedom.

A chance.

A stable platform for new cruelty or new care.

The choice would not be made by gods.

It would be made by systems.

And systems were her language.

## Notes

- Continuity: The partition’s aftermath creates three spaces: the living city, the dead-world court, and an in-between corridor where some fall through.
- Foreshadowing: Ren is positioned as a potential bridge across worlds; the marshal must redefine Cinderbound purpose without direct access to the Compact; Gao Yue begins building institutions for the dead-world, setting the stage for new factions shaped by the three-world cosmology.
