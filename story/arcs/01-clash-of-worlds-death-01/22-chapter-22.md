## Scene 1

- **POV**: A Cinderbound marshal
- **Location**: An abandoned kiln-house outside the outer wards
- **Goal**: Report the pushback; learn what the Cinderbound actually want from the city

The kiln-house still smelled like old heat.

That was why they met here.

Heat carried memory.

Memory made men careful.

The marshal arrived with soot on his sleeves and victory in his mouth.

Victory was a dangerous flavor.

It made people swallow too fast.

Inside the kiln-house, three figures waited.

Not seated like nobles.

Not standing like soldiers.

Arranged like tools on a workbench.

The first was the Furnace Matron, hair bound in copper wire, eyes steady as coals.

The second was Ash-Recorder, a thin man with ink-stained fingers who wrote on paper he never showed anyone.

The third was the one the marshal disliked most.

A stranger.

Clean.

Unburned.

A mouth that still believed in doors.

The marshal bowed.

Not deep.

Cinderbound did not bow deep.

Deep bows belonged to courts.

“The White Column turned,” the marshal said.

The Furnace Matron did not smile.

“How quickly?” she asked.

“Twice,” the marshal replied. “They tried to reassert. They retreated. They returned to the gate.”

Ash-Recorder’s pen scratched.

The marshal watched the ink.

It didn’t look like ink.

It looked like something that had once been alive.

The stranger spoke.

“You pushed them back,” he said.

His tone was not admiration.

It was evaluation.

The marshal’s jaw tightened.

“We did,” he said.

The Furnace Matron’s gaze flicked to the marshal.

“And did you take what mattered?” she asked.

The marshal hesitated.

He had taken carts.

He had taken morale.

He had taken a story.

He had not taken the thing the Compact guarded like a god.

“No,” he admitted.

The kiln-house stayed quiet.

Silence did not accuse.

Silence invited you to speak your own guilt.

The marshal forced himself to continue.

“They keep lacquer cases,” he said. “They carry them like relics. One leaked ink. Their clerks panicked.”

Ash-Recorder’s pen slowed.

The Furnace Matron leaned forward.

“The Name-Eater,” she said.

The marshal nodded.

He hated that the nobles’ weapon had a name that sounded like a child’s nightmare.

He hated more that it worked.

The stranger’s eyes sharpened.

“You saw it?” he asked.

The marshal’s mouth tightened.

“I saw its case,” he said. “I saw it misbehave.”

Ash-Recorder looked up.

“Misbehave,” he repeated.

The marshal shrugged.

“Cough,” he said. “Spit. Fail. I don’t know their priest words.”

The Furnace Matron exhaled.

“Failure spreads faster than fire,” she said.

The marshal felt his own pride swell.

“That’s why we used their chant,” he said. “That’s why we used the King’s phrase.”

Ash-Recorder’s pen stopped.

The stranger’s mouth curved.

“The Spirit King spoke,” he said.

The marshal’s smile sharpened.

“And the city learned a new sentence,” he replied.

Count them back.

A phrase that felt like a knife you could hand to anyone.

The Furnace Matron’s gaze stayed cold.

“Borrowed words,” she said. “Borrowed fire. Borrowed courage.”

The marshal’s pride cooled.

He knew what she meant.

Borrowed things came with creditors.

The stranger leaned forward.

“You want the city,” he said.

The marshal’s jaw tightened.

“We want the Compact gone,” he replied.

The Furnace Matron did not correct him.

That made him uneasy.

Because it meant his answer was incomplete.

Ash-Recorder spoke, voice dry.

“The Compact is not only marble,” he said. “It is paper. It is hunger. It is the promise that someone will be responsible for your stomach.”

The marshal’s throat tightened.

“Yes,” he said.

Ash-Recorder continued.

“If we remove the Compact without replacing the promise,” he said, “the city will not become free. It will become available.”

Available.

A word that meant: owned by whoever arrived next.

The stranger’s eyes glittered.

“That’s why you need a court,” he said.

The marshal felt anger flare.

“We are not a court,” he snapped.

The Furnace Matron’s gaze hardened.

“Watch your mouth,” she said.

Not as a threat.

As a reminder.

Mouths made institutions.

The marshal swallowed.

The stranger held up his hands.

“I’m not insulting you,” he said. “I’m describing what the city will demand. They will demand protection.”

Protection.

The sweet word.

The marshal’s nails dug into his palm.

The Furnace Matron spoke.

“We do not promise protection,” she said.

The stranger blinked.

“Then you will lose,” he said.

Ash-Recorder’s pen scratched again.

The Furnace Matron’s voice stayed calm.

“We promise leverage,” she said. “We promise that the people who have been counted will learn to count.”

The marshal felt the phrase land in him.

Not borrowed.

Forged.

The Furnace Matron looked at him.

“Your pushback was good,” she said. “Now you will do the next thing.”

The marshal exhaled.

“What?”

The Furnace Matron’s eyes were steady.

“You will stop treating the city as a stage,” she said. “You will treat it as a furnace.”

The marshal frowned.

“A furnace for what?”

Ash-Recorder answered.

“For habits,” he said.

Habits.

The word Ren had used.

The marshal’s stomach tightened.

He did not like that the sect woman’s language matched theirs.

It meant she understood the game.

The Furnace Matron continued.

“The Compact will turn outward failure into inward tightening,” she said. “They will audit mouths. They will inventory questions.”

The marshal nodded.

“They already started,” he said.

The Furnace Matron’s gaze sharpened.

“How do you know?”

The marshal smiled without humor.

“Because the refugees talk,” he said. “Because fear runs ahead of paperwork.”

Ash-Recorder’s pen scratched faster.

The Furnace Matron’s voice lowered.

“Then we make the Audit expensive,” she said.

The marshal’s blood warmed.

“Fire?” he asked.

The Furnace Matron shook her head.

“Not yet,” she said.

The marshal’s smile faltered.

The stranger sighed.

“Always ‘not yet’ with you people,” he muttered.

The Furnace Matron ignored him.

She looked at the marshal.

“You will steal a lacquer case,” she said.

The marshal’s heart hammered.

“The Name-Eater?”

Ash-Recorder’s voice was flat.

“Or the forms,” he said. “Or the ration seals. Anything that proves their system is not a god.”

The marshal swallowed.

“That will make them escalate,” he said.

The Furnace Matron nodded.

“Yes,” she replied.

The marshal stared.

“You want escalation?”

The Furnace Matron’s gaze did not waver.

“I want the Compact to reveal itself,” she said. “Not as marble. As hunger with a knife.”

The kiln-house felt colder.

Ash-Recorder’s pen stopped.

The stranger leaned back.

“And the sect woman?” he asked.

The marshal’s jaw tightened.

“Lady Qiu Ren,” he said.

The Furnace Matron’s eyes flicked.

“She is building habits too,” she said.

The marshal felt irritation flare.

“She refuses to partner,” he said.

The Furnace Matron nodded.

“Good,” she replied.

The marshal blinked.

“Good?”

Ash-Recorder spoke.

“If she partnered, she would become ours,” he said. “If she becomes ours, she becomes predictable.”

The marshal stared.

“And predictable is safe,” he said.

Ash-Recorder’s mouth twitched.

“And safe is owned,” he replied.

The Furnace Matron stood.

Meeting over.

She looked at the marshal.

“Push them back,” she said. “But do not be the next marble. Do you understand?”

The marshal swallowed.

“Yes,” he said.

He did not know if he did.

But he knew what the alternative was.

A city that traded one stamp for another.

A city that called the new stamp freedom.

The marshal bowed, not deep.

And left the kiln-house with the taste of ash and responsibility.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Jian
- **Location**: A ration point near the gate district
- **Goal**: Pass the Safety Audit without losing his mouth

The Audit had a table.

Everything dangerous had a table.

Clerks sat behind it with clipboards.

Guards stood beside it with hands on spears.

A priest stood behind them with a basin and a smile.

Jian waited in line and tried to remember what his face looked like when it was innocent.

Innocence was exhausting.

A woman in front of him clutched a child and a ration seal.

The child’s eyes were too bright.

The kind of bright that meant fever.

The clerk called the woman forward.

“Name,” the clerk said.

The woman spoke it.

The clerk wrote.

“Where do you get your bread?”

“Here,” the woman whispered.

“Who do you speak to?”

The woman swallowed.

“No one,” she said.

The clerk’s pen paused.

“No one,” he repeated.

The woman nodded too fast.

The guard’s eyes narrowed.

The priest smiled.

The smile did not reach his eyes.

“Have you heard the phrase count them back?” the clerk asked.

Jian felt his throat seize.

The woman hesitated.

It was a small hesitation.

But the table loved small hesitations.

The clerk’s eyes sharpened.

The woman’s mouth opened.

“No,” she said.

The clerk watched her.

He wrote something.

Not a note.

A mark.

The woman’s shoulders sagged.

She did not know whether she had passed.

Passing was not a feeling.

Passing was a permission you only learned you lacked when it was revoked.

The woman was waved aside.

Jian stepped forward.

The clerk looked at him.

“Name,” the clerk said.

Jian said it.

He did not add a surname.

He did not know if that was courage or stupidity.

The clerk frowned.

“Registry surname?” he asked.

Jian’s stomach turned.

He had delayed the Registry.

Delayed meant: suspicious.

“I—” Jian began.

The clerk’s pen hovered.

Behind the clerk, a guard shifted.

The spear’s tip gleamed.

Jian forced himself to speak.

“I haven’t,” he said. “Not yet.”

The clerk’s eyes narrowed.

“Not yet,” he repeated.

Jian nodded.

The clerk wrote.

Jian tried not to flinch.

The clerk’s voice stayed flat.

“Where do you get your bread?” he asked.

“Here,” Jian said.

“Who do you speak to?”

Jian swallowed.

He thought of Ren.

Of counter-seals.

Of the recipe.

He thought of the Cinderbound recruiter’s warm voice.

Marble couldn’t protect you. But fire can.

He forced his face to stay boring.

“No one,” he said.

The clerk’s pen paused.

Jian’s heart hammered.

Then the clerk asked the question.

“Have you heard the phrase count them back?”

Jian felt the sentence in his throat like a stone.

He could lie.

He could survive.

He could keep his mouth.

He could also tell the truth and lose everything.

The clerk waited.

The table waited.

The city waited.

Jian opened his mouth.

“No,” he said.

It tasted like ash.

The clerk wrote.

The guard relaxed by a fraction.

The priest smiled.

Jian took his ration seal and stepped away.

He had passed.

He had also learned the Audit’s real purpose.

Not to find rebels.

To teach everyone the shape of fear.

To make lying a habit.

To make truth a luxury.

## Notes

- Continuity: The Cinderbound leadership meets and sets strategy: keep the pushback pressure while targeting Compact legitimacy by stealing key artifacts (lacquer cases/forms); the Compact begins rolling out the Safety Audit at ration points in the gate district.
- Foreshadowing: Both sides converge on “habits” (auditing mouths vs teaching help); an upcoming operation targets the Compact’s carried tools (possibly a Name-Eater case), which will force a new escalation.
