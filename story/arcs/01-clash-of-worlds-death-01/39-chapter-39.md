## Scene 1

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: A boundary line drawn through a market square
- **Goal**: Keep the truce from collapsing into old habits; prevent the factions from using the breach as an excuse to purge each other

Morning did not fix anything.

Morning only made the damage visible.

The market square was split by a line of salt.

On one side, Compact enforcers stood in neat rows.

On the other, Cinderbound fighters stood in loose readiness.

Between them, the city stood.

Not a third faction.

A third truth.

Hunger.

Fear.

Memory slipping.

Ren moved along the line with bowls.

He fed the people who held the lanterns.

Fed the people who carried salt.

Fed the people who would kill each other the moment the mouth vanished.

“Why are you doing this?” a Compact guard asked.

Ren handed him broth.

“So you can keep standing,” Ren replied.

The guard frowned.

“So you can keep obeying?”

Ren shook his head.

“So you can keep being a person,” he said.

A shout rose.

“Bandits!”

Old word.

Old reflex.

A Compact clerk pointed at a Cinderbound runner.

A Cinderbound lieutenant spat.

Hands tightened on weapons.

Ren felt the truce fray.

Not because of the mouth.

Because of pride.

Pride was the oldest hungry realm.

He stepped between them.

“Stop,” he said.

Two sides stared.

He hated the attention.

Attention was how you became a symbol.

Symbols got executed.

He lifted a bowl.

“You can kill each other after the world stops chewing,” he said.

Someone laughed.

Someone almost cried.

Then the salt line trembled.

A breath ran through the square.

Cold.

Deep.

Not weather.

An inhale from elsewhere.

The mouth rose.

Bigger than last night.

As if it had been eating while they argued.

Ren’s stomach dropped.

The world was not waiting for their politics.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Lady Gao Yue
- **Location**: The court steps, facing a sky that has begun to split
- **Goal**: Hold the Compact together as reality fails; decide whether to sacrifice legitimacy for survival

The sky had a seam.

A pale line.

Like paper about to tear.

Lady Gao Yue looked up and felt a rare sensation.

Smallness.

Not fear.

Not awe.

A calculation that had no numbers.

A messenger stumbled to her.

“Mouth expanding,” he said. “Salt lines failing.”

Lady Gao Yue’s eyes narrowed.

“Bring more,” she said.

The messenger shook.

“We are out,” he whispered.

Out.

The Compact had never been out of anything.

It had always had an inventory.

If it was out, then the world was out.

She turned to the clerks.

“Open the court stores,” she ordered.

A clerk froze.

“Lady, that will—”

“—destroy precedent,” she finished for him.

She exhaled.

“Good,” she said. “Precedent is useless if there is no world to enforce it.”

The clerks stared as if she had spoken heresy.

She did not care.

Heresy was only dangerous in stable worlds.

A tremor ran through the steps.

Marble cracked.

Not from riot.

From the sky.

The seam above widened.

A dark beyond-dark looked through.

Lady Gao Yue’s throat tightened.

She had built her life on the belief that everything could be managed.

Now she saw a thing that did not want management.

It wanted an ending.

She looked down at the city.

At the Cinderbound.

At the kitchens.

At her own guards.

Two factions.

One catastrophe.

She spoke, and her voice did not shake.

“Send word,” she said. “We cease faction hostilities. We hold the line.”

A captain blinked.

“For how long?”

Lady Gao Yue stared at the splitting sky.

“As long as there is a sky,” she replied.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: The Spirit King
- **Location**: The point where the world’s single river wants to overflow into nothing
- **Goal**: Act; split the load; prevent the hungry realm from becoming the default future

The world was one wound.

Not because of war.

Because it insisted on being one.

One bed.

One flow.

One roof.

All meanings stacked.

All deaths pressed together.

Pressure found seams.

Seams became doors.

The hungry realm did not have to invade.

It only had to wait for the world to fail its own architecture.

He watched the factions try to cooperate.

Watched Ren feed the line.

Watched Gao Yue break precedent.

Watched the marshal hold salt with hands that still refused crowns.

They were learning.

But learning was slow.

The hungry realm was patient.

Patience was its genius.

He moved.

Not with footsteps.

With decision.

He reached for the world’s single river.

Felt the pressure.

Felt the souls.

Felt the living.

Felt the dead.

Felt the hungry absence pressing from the other side.

He did not tighten.

He did not crown.

He did not stamp.

He split.

Not yet into named places.

First into directions.

Up.

Down.

Else.

He created distance.

Distance was mercy.

Distance was containment.

The sky seam paused.

As if surprised.

The mouth shuddered.

As if suddenly less fed.

He held the split in his hands.

A world trying to become three.

And he realized the price.

Nothing that was divided ever forgot it had been whole.

## Notes

- Continuity: The one-night truce strains under old labels and pride; breaches worsen and begin affecting the sky itself. Gao Yue breaks precedent to prioritize survival.
- Foreshadowing: The Spirit King initiates the first act of division—creating distance and directional partition—setting up the full three-world split.
