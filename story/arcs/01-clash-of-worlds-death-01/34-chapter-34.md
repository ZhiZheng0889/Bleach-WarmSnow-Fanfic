# Chapter 34 — The Court Tries to Bite

## Scene 1

- **POV**: Lady Gao Yue
- **Location**: The white court’s outer steps
- **Goal**: Reassert sovereignty by forcing a confrontation on her terms

The court had always been built to be looked at.

It was a face.

A smooth face.

A face that pretended it could not bruise.

Lady Gao Yue stood behind the screens and listened to the steps fill.

Crowds again.

But not the same crowd.

Not petitioners.

Not supplicants.

A crowd that had learned to take.

She signaled.

The screens parted.

She stepped out.

A chorus of noise rose.

Not applause.

Not chants.

Arguments.

Accusations.

Hunger made language sharp.

She raised her hands.

The guards struck their halberds against stone.

A hard rhythm.

The crowd quieted out of reflex.

Reflex was also a kind of chain.

“Citizens,” she said.

The word tasted like theft.

Because the Compact had never meant it.

But saying it made it sound true.

“We are restoring order,” she continued. “We are reopening distribution. We are punishing banditry.”

A stone flew.

It struck a pillar.

White dust puffed like powdered bone.

Someone laughed.

Someone screamed.

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze tracked the thrower.

A boy.

Thin.

Too young to hate properly.

“Order,” he shouted, “is your bowl!”

The crowd surged.

Lady Gao Yue’s heart did not race.

She was not built for panic.

She was built for consequence.

She leaned toward her captain.

“Bring the Audit warrants,” she whispered.

The captain hesitated.

“Here?”

“Yes,” she said. “On the steps. In front of everyone.”

Because power was a performance.

And she would make the court bite.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: A Cinderbound marshal
- **Location**: The palace district streets approaching the steps
- **Goal**: Prevent a massacre; keep the Compact from creating martyrs

The marshal heard the crowd before he saw it.

A wall of sound.

He hated crowds.

Crowds wanted leaders.

Leaders wanted thrones.

Thrones wanted blood.

A runner found him.

“They’re gathering at the court,” she said.

He did not ask who.

He already knew.

Everyone.

He moved fast.

His fighters followed.

Not in a wedge.

Not in formation.

Formation was how you became an army.

Armies became states.

He reached the palace district.

Saw the steps.

Saw the white banners.

Saw Gao Yue’s silhouette.

Saw the guards raise their weapons.

He pushed through the crowd.

Hands grabbed him.

Not to stop.

To pull.

To ask.

To beg.

He shook them off gently.

“No crowns,” he muttered.

A stone flew.

A halberd swung.

A scream cut through the air.

Then the first body fell.

Not dead.

But bleeding.

Bleeding on the court steps.

That was how history started.

He stepped onto the lowest step.

Lifted both hands.

“Stop!” he shouted.

The guards hesitated.

Because even courts respected a blade.

The crowd stared.

Because even crowds believed in a figure.

He hated that too.

“Back,” he ordered.

Someone yelled.

“Take it!”

“Take the court!”

His jaw clenched.

“No,” he said.

The word was a slap.

Confusion rippled.

Gao Yue’s eyes narrowed.

She smiled.

A smile that meant she had found the angle.

“If you will not take it,” she called, voice clear, “then you admit you cannot hold it.”

The crowd murmured.

The marshal swallowed his anger.

He looked at the bleeding body.

At the guards.

At Gao Yue.

At the crowd that wanted an answer shaped like a throne.

“I admit nothing,” he said.

Then he stepped down.

Not retreat.

Refusal.

Refusal in public.

Refusal that made the court look ridiculous.

For a heartbeat, the crowd did not know what to do.

That was his opening.

“Carry them,” he said, pointing to the wounded. “To the clinics. Now.”

People moved.

Not because of the Compact.

Not because of the Cinderbound.

Because pain was real.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: The Spirit King
- **Location**: The underside of the court’s marble
- **Goal**: Observe how refusal destabilizes authority; feel the breach widen under public blood

Blood on marble was not new.

What was new was blood without a king.

No coronation.

No conquest.

Only a step.

A shove.

A fall.

The court tried to bite and found no throat to clamp.

So it bit the crowd.

He felt the wound.

Not the body.

The meaning.

Public blood made spirits wake.

It made the dead remember they had unfinished arguments.

And in the loosened seam, the hungry mouth from the ash breathed again.

He heard it clearly now.

A scrape of teeth that were not teeth.

A desire that did not know how to stop.

He had wanted motion.

He had gotten opening.

Openings were dangerous.

Because openings invited things that did not care about vows.

He watched the crowd carry the wounded.

He watched the marshal refuse the throne again.

He watched Gao Yue turn refusal into accusation.

Two factions.

One city.

A third hunger.

And above them, the world’s oldest wall starting to crack.

## Notes

- Continuity: Gao Yue forces a public confrontation at the court steps; the marshal intervenes to prevent a massacre but refuses again to seize the throne-space.
- Foreshadowing: Public blood and collapsing authority widen the seam; the ash-hunger grows more audible beneath the court’s marble.
