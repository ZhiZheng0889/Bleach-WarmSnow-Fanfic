## Scene 1

- **POV**: Lady Gao Yue
- **Location**: Temporary forward headquarters (a seized granary)
- **Goal**: Prevent the defeat from becoming a myth; order a counter-march without admitting retreat

They returned with smoke in their hair.

Not enough to call it a rout.

Enough to make it contagious.

Lady Gao Yue stood in the seized granary and watched Captain Liang report.

His uniform was clean.

His eyes were not.

“An ambush,” he said.

A safe word.

Ambush implied an enemy who fought like criminals.

It implied a response that could be called justice.

Lady Gao Yue did not correct him.

She only asked the real question.

“How fast?”

Liang swallowed.

“Within hours,” he admitted.

Hours.

The invasion had been thwarted before it had learned the terrain.

That was dangerous.

Not because of the loss.

Because of the *speed*.

Speed became a story.

A story became recruitment.

A priest frowned.

“They mocked our chant,” he said.

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze slid to him.

“They used it,” she corrected.

The priest blinked.

She continued.

“Mockery stays outside the skin,” she said. “Use gets under it.”

The councilwoman’s mouth tightened.

“The street will hear,” she said.

Lady Gao Yue nodded.

“Yes,” she replied.

Not with fear.

With acceptance.

So the blank bit back.

Good.

Now the Compact could justify the next step.

Lady Gao Yue turned to the clerk.

“Draft the emergency bulletin,” she said.

The clerk’s hands moved fast.

Lady Gao Yue spoke as if dictating weather.

“By order of the Marble Compact: the outer wards have been infiltrated by fire-bandits. The White Column has secured a forward granary. All citizens are reminded that repeating seditious phrases aids the enemy.”

The councilwoman exhaled.

“They’ll call it a setback,” she said.

Lady Gao Yue’s voice did not change.

“We will call it a test,” she replied.

A priest leaned in.

“And the test’s answer?”

Lady Gao Yue looked at the grain sacks stacked to the rafters.

Bread.

Always bread.

“We answer with heat,” she said.

The priest’s eyes brightened.

“Cleansing?”

Lady Gao Yue did not use that word.

She used the word that let people sleep.

“Containment,” she said.

Then she turned to Captain Liang.

“You will counter-march,” she said.

Liang’s jaw tightened.

“With what?” he asked.

Lady Gao Yue’s gaze stayed steady.

“With everything that makes the Compact real,” she said.

Forms.

Ration seals.

Patrols.

A court that traveled.

“And with fire?” Liang asked.

Lady Gao Yue’s smile was thin.

“With controlled fire,” she said.

Liang did not smile back.

No fire was controlled.

But he nodded.

Because he was an officer.

Because officers were how rulers pretended uncertainty was discipline.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Captain Liang
- **Location**: The grain road at dusk
- **Goal**: Reassert initiative; survive the Cinderbound’s second strike

The counter-march looked more like a siege wagon than a column.

Liang had ordered iron-capped wheels.

He had ordered water carts.

He had ordered that no one laugh.

Laughter was how fear leaked.

They moved at dusk.

Not for stealth.

For optics.

Torchlight made an army look endless.

Endless made peasants choose obedience.

Liang watched the ridge where the relay shrine sat.

Smoke stained it.

The shrine keeper had vanished.

Either dead.

Or recruited.

Either outcome served someone.

A clerk rode beside Liang.

“Captain,” the clerk said, voice tight, “do we deploy the Name-Eater if we find sect leaders?”

Liang’s stomach turned.

“Not unless necessary,” he said.

The clerk nodded.

The clerk did not believe him.

Liang didn’t either.

They reached the burned place.

Char.

Broken axle.

Blackened grain.

Liang’s jaw clenched.

A defeated supply was a defeated promise.

A peacekeeper stepped toward the ash and spat.

“Cowards,” she muttered.

Liang’s gaze snapped to her.

“Do not insult your enemy,” he said.

She blinked.

Liang continued.

“Insults are for people you think you can afford to misunderstand,” he said.

The peacekeeper swallowed.

“Yes, Captain.”

A sound drifted from the tree line.

Not a shout.

A hum.

As if someone was singing without words.

Liang’s spine stiffened.

Cinderbound.

He raised his hand.

“Halt,” he ordered.

The column stopped.

Torches guttered.

The hum continued.

Then a voice spoke.

From the ridge.

From the dark.

“You brought iron wheels,” the voice called.

Liang’s teeth clenched.

He recognized the cadence.

Not a soldier.

A performer.

A recruiter.

“You brought water,” the voice continued. “You brought forms. You brought your little traveling court.”

The torches flared.

A figure stepped into view.

Cinderbound marshal.

Smile bright.

Hands empty.

Liang’s mouth tightened.

“What do you want?” Liang shouted.

The marshal laughed.

“I want you to be honest,” he called.

Liang’s grip tightened on his spear.

“We are securing the road,” Liang said.

The marshal’s laughter sharpened.

“No,” he said. “You are invading.”

The word hit the column.

Some peacekeepers shifted.

Some clerks flinched.

Invasion was a naked word.

It did not allow the lie of protection.

The marshal lifted his hands.

“Fine,” he said. “Invade.”

He looked down the road.

“Just don’t be surprised when the road invades you back.”

Then the hum changed.

Not music.

Breath.

Flames leapt from the ditch.

Not in front.

Behind.

A wall of fire, placed like punctuation.

Liang’s stomach dropped.

They were bracketed.

Front and rear.

A trap made of heat.

Liang shouted.

“Water carts!”

Peacekeepers ran.

Clerks screamed.

The fire did not rush.

It waited.

Like a patient animal.

Liang understood.

The Cinderbound weren’t trying to burn the column.

They were trying to make it *turn*.

To shove it back toward the city with fear in its mouth.

Liang’s jaw clenched.

He made the decision the Compact could not admit it needed.

“Retreat,” he ordered.

The clerk stared.

Liang did not soften.

“Fall back to the granary,” he snapped.

The column began to move backward.

Backward.

A march with its eyes on the past.

Liang felt humiliation burn hotter than the ditch fire.

The invasion had been thwarted.

Again.

And now the pushback had begun.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Lady Qiu Ren
- **Location**: A culvert under the grain road
- **Goal**: Keep the retreat from becoming a massacre; prevent Cinderbound “protection” from swallowing survivors

Ren crouched under the road and listened to boots above her.

Not the steady cadence of conquest.

The uneven scramble of retreat.

The Cinderbound had done what Ren feared they would do.

They had not only defeated the column.

They had choreographed the defeat.

So that the survivors would carry the lesson home.

Yan’s voice was a whisper.

“They’re pushing them back,” he said.

Ren nodded.

The pushback was not a single strike.

It was pressure.

A hand on the spine.

A shove toward the city.

Ren peered through the culvert’s mouth.

She saw a peacekeeper stumble, coughing.

She saw a clerk clutching forms like they were prayers.

She saw a child—why was there a child?—clinging to a cart.

Refugees.

The invasion had already started producing the thing it claimed to prevent.

Bandits.

Displaced.

Hungry.

Ren’s fingers tightened on her pouch.

Counter-seals.

Not a sword.

Not a banner.

A small refusal of monopoly.

A shadow moved on the ridge.

The Cinderbound marshal again.

He waved to the retreating column like a host sending guests home.

Ren’s stomach turned.

He was not just winning.

He was advertising.

Yan’s hand flexed on his blade.

Ren grabbed his wrist.

“Not yet,” she breathed.

Yan’s eyes were furious.

“How many times?” he whispered.

Ren swallowed.

“Until we can cut the scrolls without giving them a story,” she said.

Yan’s jaw clenched.

Ren watched the column move backward.

Backward.

The Compact would call it regrouping.

The street would call it fear.

The Cinderbound would call it proof.

And somewhere in the middle, people would decide which kind of protection tasted least like a chain.

## Notes

- Continuity: The Compact counter-marches to reassert control, but the Cinderbound trap the column with staged fires and force a second retreat; the invasion has been effectively thwarted and begins turning into a sustained pushback.
- Foreshadowing: Retreat produces refugees and loosens Compact legitimacy; the Cinderbound’s victories double as recruitment campaigns, pressuring Ren to act without feeding either side’s propaganda.
