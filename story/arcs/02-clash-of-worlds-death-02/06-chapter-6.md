# Chapter 6 — Shadow Walker Steals the Crown Rite

## Scene 1

- **POV**: Lin Shun (Shadow Walker infiltrator)
- **Location**: Palace-adjacent archive tunnels
- **Goal**: Remove the Compact’s next rite before it can be performed

Shadow Walker did not believe in frontal battles.

Fronts were where courts wanted you.

If you fought where the banners were, you taught the banners that you accepted their stage.

Lin Shun moved in the tunnels behind the palace with a coil of wire and a mouth full of silence.

Ahead, two wardens spoke in low tones.

“Draft’s done,” one said. “A rite for the question-plague.

We’ll make asking feel like blasphemy.”

The other chuckled.

“People will beg to be told what to think.”

Lin Shun listened, memorized the cadence, and breathed out.

Not anger.

A plan.

He slipped a thin blade between stone seams.

A lock gave.

A door opened.

Inside, scrolls lay stacked like ammunition.

At the center was a lacquer box.

He recognized it from rumors.

Not the Name-Eater.

Something made for crowds.

A crown rite.

A ritual device designed to take the Spirit King’s refusal and turn it into a blessing anyway.

Lin Shun’s hands stayed steady.

He did not steal gold.

He stole futures.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Palace warden
- **Location**: Archive entry
- **Goal**: Secure the rite materials; maintain the illusion of control

The warden checked the seals.

Intact.

He relaxed.

Relaxation was when the Shadow Walkers ate you.

He turned the corner and saw the lacquer box open.

Empty.

His mouth dried.

He ran to the scroll stacks.

Missing.

Not random.

Selected.

The drafts for the rite.

The official phrasing that would make questions sinful.

The warden’s voice cracked.

“Alarm!”

Bells rang.

But bells were slow.

Shadow was faster.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Lin Shun
- **Location**: Furnace district, hidden theater of rites
- **Goal**: Flip the rite; weaponize the nobles’ sacred language against them

Lin Shun arrived at a basement hall where Hellborne performers waited with inks and masks.

Madam Lian was there.

So was Monk Zhen.

So was a Cinderbound elder with soot-streaked knuckles.

Lin Shun placed the stolen drafts on the table.

“They were going to make questions feel sinful,” he said.

The Cinderbound elder snorted.

“Then we make obedience feel embarrassing,” she replied.

Madam Lian skimmed the text and smiled.

“They wrote it like a hymn,” she said.

Monk Zhen tapped a line.

“This part,” he said. “The part where they say the Compact answers for you.

We can invert it.”

Lin Shun nodded.

“Do it,” he said.

They worked by lanternlight.

Not rewriting the rite into rebellion.

Rewriting it into a mirror.

A rite that sounded familiar enough to pass guard ears.

A rite that ended with a question that could not be outlawed without making the outlaw obvious.

When they finished, Madam Lian read the final line aloud:

“*If safety requires silence, who benefits from your quiet?*”

Silence followed.

Then laughter.

Low.

Relieved.

Not because it was funny.

Because it was true.

Lin Shun exhaled.

The nobles had lost the crown rite.

Soul Society would respond with force.

But force was clumsy.

And clumsy tools broke when you made them swing at shadows.

## Notes
- Shadow Walker’s “defeat” is preemption: steals the next escalation before it spreads.
- Hellborne synergy: flips propaganda drafts into a counter-rite that survives censorship.
- Soul Society disadvantage: reliance on public rituals makes them vulnerable to infiltration.
