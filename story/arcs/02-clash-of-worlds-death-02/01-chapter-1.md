## Scene 1

- **POV**: Nian He (Bitter River Bodhi vice leader)
- **Location**: Lower canal ward, beneath Marble Compact patrol routes
- **Goal**: Turn the nobles’ ration lattice into a floodplain

The river was never polite.

The Houses built canals to teach water obedience.

Bitter River Bodhi learned the opposite lesson: if you cannot stop a flow, you redirect it until the people who called it *order* drown in their own certainty.

Nian He knelt in a maintenance tunnel with wet stone under her palms and listened to the city above.

Boots.

Carts.

The measured clink of registry seals.

Administration had a rhythm. It was how you knew where to cut.

A Hellborne runner crouched beside her—ash in the creases of his fingers, chain tattoos half-hidden under wrapped cloth.

“The Compact’s patrols changed,” he whispered.

Nian He didn’t look up.

“They always do when they think they’re safe,” she said.

She traced the seam where old mortar met new repairs. The nobles had reinforced everything after the riots: barriers, locks, the illusion that a city could be made unbreachable by writing “authorized” on a scroll.

Water did not recognize scrolls.

The Hellborne runner slid her a folded diagram: not inked in calligrapher’s strokes, but scratched in charcoal like a furnace worker’s shorthand.

A map of hunger.

Ration hall nodes.

Guard choke points.

Where grain carts parked.

Where the canal gates could be opened without anyone having to admit they were the one who opened them.

Nian He exhaled.

“Good,” she said.

Above them, a bell rang.

Curfew.

A clean sound meant to feel protective.

Nian He rose.

“Tell the Cinderbound,” she said. “We don’t break the lattice by burning it.

We break it by feeding through it.

And then—when they call it theft—we let the river answer.”

## Scene 2

- **POV**: A Marble Compact patrol captain
- **Location**: Canal Bridge Six
- **Goal**: Prove the city is governed; stop “bandit distribution”

The captain had been promoted for neatness.

He could align a patrol line so straight it made people relax.

Relaxed people were easier to register.

Tonight, the air smelled wrong.

Not smoke.

Not sweat.

Wet stone.

A clerk approached with a ledger hugged tight to his chest.

“Captain,” the clerk said, “the ration hall reports shortages.

Seals are being… duplicated.”

The captain laughed once, sharp.

“Paper can’t be duplicated,” he said. “Only authority.”

The clerk swallowed.

“They’re using different stamps,” he whispered.

The captain’s smile thinned.

Different stamps meant a different language.

And languages did not like sharing a city.

He turned to his guards.

“Search the alleyways,” he ordered. “Confiscate any unauthorized marks.

Arrest anyone distributing without registry approval.”

A guard hesitated.

“Captain… the hungry are lining up at the bridge.”

The captain stepped forward.

The crowd was there indeed—faces pulled tight by winter and weeks of controlled bowls.

They weren’t shouting.

They weren’t chanting.

They were waiting.

That was more threatening than anger.

He lifted his baton.

“By authority of the Marble Compact—”

A woman in front raised her hand.

Not to plead.

To show him a seal.

It was not white.

It was dark, burned into fiber like a brand.

A simple Bitter River symbol: a crooked line that refused straightening.

“Who gave you that?” the captain demanded.

The woman’s eyes were tired.

“The ones who didn’t ask my name first,” she said.

The captain felt something cold move behind his ribs.

He raised his baton higher.

Then the canal gates beneath the bridge opened.

Not a crack.

A release.

Water surged up, sudden as truth.

The captain stumbled.

His guards broke formation.

The ledger slipped from the clerk’s hands and slapped into the flood, ink blooming into uselessness.

The hungry did not run.

They stepped forward into the water, laughing in disbelief as the current carried crates—grain crates—out from under a locked depot.

Food, freed by physics.

The captain screamed for order.

His voice vanished under the roar.

And above the bridge, in the fog, Nian He watched.

Not smiling.

Counting.

Because a flood was not just water.

It was proof.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: A Soul Society observer (low-seated messenger)
- **Location**: Rooftops overlooking the canal ward
- **Goal**: Report “anomalous governance” to superiors; decide whether to intervene

The messenger wore the uniform of an institution that believed it had already won history.

He had been sent to catalogue instability.

To name it.

To file it.

He watched the canal bridge from above and felt his certainty fail in small increments.

The nobles’ patrol line broke.

The crowd did not become a mob.

It became a distribution system.

Someone in the alley raised a lantern twice.

Someone else rolled carts into the flood’s edge with practiced timing.

Not chaos.

Coordination.

The messenger’s hand tightened on his report scroll.

He was supposed to write: *Hellborne sabotage. Ten Sects agitation. Noble governance endangered.*

But the scene refused his categories.

The people were not being led by a banner.

They were being led by need, answered efficiently.

The messenger whispered, almost involuntarily:

“They’re governing.”

A senior officer behind him snorted.

“Governing is not allowed,” the officer said.

The messenger looked back.

The officer’s eyes were calm.

Calm like a blade in its sheath.

“Write this,” the officer continued. “Write that the river is being weaponized.

Write that the realm requires stabilization.

Write that the Soul Society cannot permit a rival court to be born from hunger.”

The messenger swallowed.

Below, the hungry laughed.

Above, the institution decided what that laughter would be called.

## Notes
- Continuity: The counter-seal becomes a material practice: food moves without registry permission.
- Hellborne edge: Engineering + mutual aid beat patrol lines without “winning” a battle.
- Soul Society pressure: Observation turns into policy—the threat is not violence, but an alternative system.
