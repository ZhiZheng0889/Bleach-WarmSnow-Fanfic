## Scene 1

- **POV**: Physician Mei (Mother Trinity field healer)
- **Location**: A back-alley clinic under bridge curfew
- **Goal**: Make care unconditional; break the nobles’ leverage over survival

The Compact’s biggest weapon was not the Name-Eater.

It was triage.

If you wanted medicine, you had to become a number.

If you wanted safety, you had to accept a mark.

Physician Mei washed her hands in cold water and felt rage move through her like fever.

A child lay on her table, coughing.

“Seal?” a guard asked from the doorway.

The guard was young.

He tried to look like authority.

His eyes kept flicking to the child.

Mei did not answer.

She ground herbs, pressed them into a paste, and placed it under the child’s tongue.

The cough eased.

The guard swallowed.

“I have orders,” he said.

Mei looked up.

“So do I,” she replied.

The guard frowned.

“From who?”

Mei’s voice stayed calm.

“From the fact that people are dying,” she said.

The guard’s cheeks colored.

“Unregistered care is collaboration,” he snapped, repeating a line like a prayer.

Mei stepped closer.

Her hands were stained green.

“Then collaborate,” she said.

The guard blinked.

Mei pointed at his sleeve.

“You got promoted for wearing that cloth,” she said. “But I can smell the bowl on your breath.

You joined for food.

So did they.

If you want to pretend hunger is a crime, arrest yourself first.”

The guard’s baton lowered.

Not from kindness.

From recognition.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Hellborne courier
- **Location**: Rooftops between clinics
- **Goal**: Build a care-network faster than the Compact can mark it

The courier carried medicine in a satchel lined with ash.

Not to hide scent.

To remind himself what kind of world he was running through.

Below, curfew patrols moved like a net.

Above, warm snow fell like the city was trying to look innocent.

He reached a roof hatch and knocked twice.

A symbol was burned into the wood.

Not a seal.

A promise.

A hand opened.

Physician Mei took the satchel without asking his name.

“Where’s the next?” she asked.

The courier gave her an address.

She nodded.

He hesitated.

“Soul Society’s been taking healers,” he said.

Mei did not flinch.

“They can take my body,” she replied. “They can’t take the rule.

No registry.

No mark.

Care first.”

The courier swallowed.

That rule was more dangerous than a sword.

It made the court’s bargain useless.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Soul Society enforcer
- **Location**: Street tribunal under white banners
- **Goal**: Force healers into compliance; preserve the coercive exchange

The enforcer read the edict aloud.

“Any who distribute medicine without registry shall be deemed collaborator.”

He looked at the line of prisoners.

Clerks.

Performers.

A healer.

Physician Mei met his gaze.

No fear.

The enforcer’s irritation rose.

Irritation was safer than doubt.

“You endanger stability,” he said.

Mei’s voice was quiet.

“Stability that requires sick people to beg is not stability,” she replied.

The crowd murmured.

The enforcer felt the murmur like heat.

He lifted a seal—white, official—and pressed it toward Mei.

“Swear,” he said. “Register.

And we will release you.”

Mei looked at the seal.

Then she looked past him, at the hungry faces.

“I won’t trade my hands for permission,” she said.

Silence.

The enforcer raised his hand.

A guard stepped forward.

Then a woman in the crowd lifted a small strip of paper.

A counter-seal.

Then another.

Then ten.

Not screaming.

Not rioting.

Showing proof that the healer belonged to them now.

The enforcer’s mouth tightened.

He realized the tribunal was losing its language.

He could arrest bodies.

But the network was already moving medicine without him.

He signaled retreat.

Mei was dragged away.

But that night, three new clinics opened.

Because care spreads when it is not owned.

## Notes
- Mother Trinity’s “defeat” is moral and logistical: removes the court’s monopoly on survival.
- Hellborne integration: couriers + counter-seal routes make unconditional care scalable.
- Soul Society fails to coerce: punishment creates more nodes instead of compliance.
