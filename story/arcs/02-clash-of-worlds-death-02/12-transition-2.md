# Chapter 12 — A Ledger of Names

## Scene 1

- **POV**: A clinic accountant (civilian)
- **Location**: A makeshift clinic office, candlelit
- **Goal**: Count the cost honestly; discover a pattern in the missing

The clinic had no marble.

It had tables.

It had bandages.

It had buckets for blood and water and things no one wanted to name.

It had a candle that burned too fast, as if the flame also wanted to leave.

And it had a ledger that kept trying to become a prayer.

The accountant—his sleeves rolled up, his fingers stained with ink—wrote names the way people wrote apologies.

Slow.

Careful.

Afraid of mistakes.

He had learned that death was not only bodies.

Death was also paperwork.

Death was also the moment a mother stopped asking at the door.

He dipped the pen, then paused.

The ink was almost out.

Everything was almost out.

Outside, someone coughed until they vomited. Someone else argued with a healer about whether their brother could be moved. The argument had no villain.

Everyone wanted the same thing.

Everyone had a different idea of how to survive long enough to get it.

The accountant wrote another name.

He added a note.

“Stitching. Fever. Stable.”

Stable.

He hated the word.

Stability was what the captain on the steps had promised.

Stability was what the nobles had always sold.

In the clinic, stability meant something simpler.

It meant you might wake up tomorrow.

He flipped to the next page.

That page was worse.

Not the injured.

The missing.

The accountant drew a line and wrote the header with a hand that tried not to shake.

Names.

Last Seen.

Notes.

He wrote the first name.

Then the second.

Then the third.

All three were marked with the same note.

Not “dead.”

Not “fled.”

Not “imprisoned.”

“Lost between.”

He stared at the phrase.

Between what?

Between districts?

Between factions?

Between one lie and the next?

The accountant had heard the phrase spoken in markets and alleys—half superstition, half resignation.

It was what people said when grief needed a direction.

He turned the page.

Found an older entry.

Different handwriting.

Different year.

Same phrase.

He turned again.

Same phrase.

He felt cold.

The clinic had been collecting this pattern like a disease that didn’t want to be diagnosed.

He leaned back in his chair.

The candle hissed.

The room smelled like tallow and antiseptic and fear.

The accountant pressed his fingers to his eyes.

He thought of the basin.

White marble.

A center.

He thought of the streets that twisted away from it.

He thought of shadows.

He thought of the things people refused to count.

If “lost between” had been appearing for years, then the city had an old wound.

And someone had been stepping into it.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Master Jian (Cloud-Splitting)
- **Location**: The clinic doorway
- **Goal**: Understand the conflict is no longer only political; it is structural

Master Jian arrived at the clinic without ceremony.

No banner.

No escort.

Only a tired body and a face that had learned how to carry consequences.

The clinic workers looked up when he entered. Some recognized him. Some did not. All of them were too exhausted to perform respect.

Master Jian appreciated that.

He walked to the desk where the accountant sat.

He did not speak at first.

He read.

Names.

Numbers.

Notes.

Then the phrase.

“Lost between.”

Master Jian’s mouth went dry.

He had spent years fighting courts that pretended their violence was the world’s natural order.

He had spent years imagining freedom as a political act.

But this—this was not politics.

This was geography.

This was architecture.

This was a crack in reality that had been eating people while everyone argued about who owned the square.

“Lost between,” he repeated.

The accountant looked up.

His eyes were bloodshot.

“It’s just what people say,” the accountant offered. “When there’s no explanation.”

Master Jian shook his head.

“People do not invent the same lie across years unless the lie is holding something together,” he said.

He thought of seams.

Of thresholds.

Of stories where the world had edges.

Master Jian’s fingers tapped the page.

“Find me anyone who came back,” he said.

The accountant hesitated.

“…There’s one rumor,” he admitted. “A young man. Claims he walked out of nowhere with civilians behind him.”

Master Jian exhaled.

Good.

Not because it was good.

Because it was next.

He turned to leave.

The accountant’s voice followed him.

“Master Jian,” he said. “If this is real—if there’s a place people vanish into—what do we call it?”

Master Jian paused at the doorway.

He listened to the clinic behind him.

Bandages.

Moans.

The soft scuff of feet carrying water.

“Call it what it is,” Master Jian said.

He looked back.

“Call it a wound,” he said. “And then stop pretending it will heal on its own.”

## Notes

- Continuity: Moves from revolution into administration (ledger/clinic) and makes “between worlds” a concrete ongoing problem.
- Foreshadowing: The missing connect directly into Death Stage 03’s inciting incidents.
