# Death Stage 02 — Clash Between Worlds (Arc Guide)

This stage continues the clash between **Order** (White Side) and **Forge** (Black Side), pushing conflict into faction-level action and consequences.

## Core Throughline

- **White Side (Order)**: stability through names, offices, registries, and enforced “proper channels”.
- **Black Side (Forge)**: stability through mutual-aid logistics, guild discipline, and visible hunger.
- **The seam** remains the quiet third actor: it rewards denial until it punishes it.

## Key Terms (quick reference)

- **Floors (Hellborne)**: cultivation-style tiers for capability/responsibility. Floors are **earned, non-hereditary**, and treated as duty assignments (to preserve the communist core while acknowledging real power gaps).
- **Hellborne tech/spellcraft**: mass-produced charms, simple devices, and versatile techniques (often non-combat) developed as shared infrastructure; improvements feed back into combat via survivability, endurance, and coordination.

## Continuity Notes

- Use each chapter’s **Characters** section to track: first appearances, power/gear changes, and any allegiance shifts.
- If a chapter introduces a new faction name, office title, Path rank, or relic term, add it here to keep terminology stable across edits.
