## Scene 1

- **POV**: Master Jian (Cloud-Splitting)
- **Location**: The square, after the speeches fracture
- **Goal**: Keep the collapse from becoming a massacre

When a stage loses its script, the actors get dangerous.

The captain on the steps reached for violence the way a drowning man reached for someone else’s throat.

Lady Gao Yue reached for rhetoric—smooth phrases, practiced sorrow, promises shaped like ownership.

The crowd reached for each other—some to stand together, some to climb.

Master Jian watched it all as if he were watching a pot boil.

If he waited, it would boil over.

If he slapped the lid down, it would explode.

He raised his empty hand again.

Not as a symbol.

As a shield.

“No,” he said.

It was a small word.

It landed hard.

The crowd heard it because it did not sound like a speech.

It sounded like a boundary.

He looked at the uniformed captain.

“If you cut down a public square,” Master Jian said, “you do not restore order. You invent a rebellion.”

The captain’s jaw flexed.

“Order is already gone,” the captain snapped.

Master Jian nodded once.

“Yes,” he said. “And you are trying to replace it with fear.”

The captain’s eyes flicked toward the basin.

Toward the idea of a center.

Master Jian followed the glance and understood.

The basin was not just stone.

It was permission.

If the captain held the basin, he could declare the square “secured.”

If he declared it secured, he could justify a sweep.

If he justified a sweep, he could bury the day’s failure beneath tomorrow’s bodies.

Master Jian stepped down into the square.

People shifted away from him without meaning to.

Not because he was famous.

Because he walked like someone who did not need anyone’s permission.

He placed himself between the captain and the crowd.

He made himself a problem both sides would have to go through.

Then he did the simplest, most infuriating thing.

He spoke to the crowd like they were adults.

“If you want the court to end,” he said, “then end it without becoming it.”

Someone in the crowd shouted, “Then what do we do?”

Master Jian pointed—not at the steps, not at the basin, but at the people.

“You decide,” he said.

It made them angry.

It also made them quiet.

Because being told you must decide is heavier than being told you must obey.

The noise did not vanish.

But it changed.

Questions replaced screams.

Hands lowered.

Some people looked ashamed.

Some looked furious.

Anger could be useful if it learned to aim at systems instead of throats.

Lady Gao Yue stepped forward, careful, elegant.

“Master Jian,” she said, voice sweet as debt. “The people need guidance.”

Master Jian looked at her.

He saw the old court hiding behind new words.

He smiled without warmth.

“They need food,” he said. “And medicine. And a way to count what was stolen.”

Gao Yue’s smile tightened.

Counting was dangerous.

Counting turned myth into numbers.

Numbers made liars nervous.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: An alley mouth overlooking the square
- **Goal**: Decide whether to reveal the door’s existence or keep it hidden

Ren watched the square the way he had watched the corridor.

Not as a place.

As an argument.

He kept the cook and the runner back in the alley, not because he did not trust them, but because crowds did.

Crowds trusted categories.

The cook looked like a civilian.

The runner looked like trouble.

The boy looked like a bargaining chip.

Ren looked like an anomaly.

He felt the seam inside him pull.

The corridor wanted him back.

Not out of kindness.

Out of possession.

He could leave.

He could take the civilians somewhere quieter.

He could also create a new rumor that would get people killed in the chase for it.

Ren watched the man with the empty hand in the square.

Not uniform.

Not noble.

Just… present.

Ren felt something in his chest loosen a fraction.

Presence was rare.

Presence did not demand.

Presence offered.

The runner leaned close.

“We should go,” she said.

Ren nodded.

Then didn’t move.

“Not yet,” he said.

The cook’s voice cracked.

“Why?”

Ren watched the captain on the steps, watched the noblewoman beside him, watched the crowd’s attention shift like a tide.

“Because if we leave now,” Ren said, “someone else will decide what we are.”

He stepped forward—not into the center, but into the edge where conversations began.

He did not announce the door.

He announced himself.

If the door became real, it would be because someone trusted a person, not because someone conquered a passage.

## Notes

- Continuity: After the White Court “ending,” focus shifts to aftermath logistics and preventing a power vacuum from becoming blood.
- Foreshadowing: The door remains a pressure point; secrecy vs transparency becomes a recurring choice.
