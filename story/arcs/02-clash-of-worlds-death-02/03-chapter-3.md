## Scene 1

- **POV**: Monk Zhen (Infinite Arhat strategist)
- **Location**: A burned registry hall turned classroom
- **Goal**: Teach the hungry to audit the people who audit them

Monk Zhen’s monastery had no walls.

Walls invited courts.

Courts invited ownership.

So Infinite Arhat built something less impressive and more dangerous: a method.

He stood inside a ruined registry hall.

The nobles had fled when Bitter River opened the gates.

Soul Society patrols had tried to retake it.

Hellborne runners had pulled the paper out before it could be used as a chain.

Now the hall held chalkboards.

Not prayer.

Arithmetic.

Zhen faced a room of workers.

“We aren’t going to fight them by hiding,” he said.

A woman raised her hand.

“We can’t fight Soul Society,” she whispered.

Zhen nodded.

“Then don’t,” he said. “Fight their assumptions.

They assume you cannot measure them.

They assume authority is a number only they can write.”

He drew two columns.

**Grain in**

**Grain out**

“Who decides?” he asked.

A boy answered, voice trembling.

“They do.”

Zhen erased the words.

“No,” he said.

“We do.

Because counting is not holiness.

It’s work.

And work is teachable.”

## Scene 2

- **POV**: A Hellborne quartermaster
- **Location**: Hidden storehouse under furnace smoke
- **Goal**: Convert audits into logistics that can outpace raids

The quartermaster did not care about slogans.

He cared about time.

If the Compact’s patrols could reach a ration hall in ten minutes, then the Hellborne had to feed it in nine.

He spread Zhen’s new “audit sheets” on a table.

Not names.

Not surnames.

Tallies.

Deliveries.

Shortfalls.

A record of where the food went that didn’t require anyone to surrender a self.

A runner returned, breath steaming.

“Soul Society’s moving,” the runner said.

“How many?”

“Small unit,” the runner answered. “Fast.

They’re targeting the chalk halls.

They call it ‘unauthorized accounting.’”

The quartermaster snorted.

“Of course they do,” he said.

He tapped the audit sheets.

“Move the lessons,” he ordered.

“Where?”

“Everywhere,” the quartermaster replied.

He pointed to the city map.

“Teach it in line.

Teach it in kitchens.

Teach it in shifts.

Let the lesson travel the way hunger travels.”

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Soul Society lieutenant
- **Location**: Alley outside the burned hall
- **Goal**: Destroy the training cells; preserve monopoly on classification

The lieutenant had trained against swords.

Against monsters.

Against what his superiors called the “inevitable violence of the lower world.”

He had not trained against accounting.

He watched through the cracked doorway.

No banners.

No war cries.

A monk teaching people to check ledgers.

The lieutenant felt offended.

Offended was the first feeling that preceded cruelty.

He stepped inside.

“By Soul Society directive,” he said, “this gathering is illegal.

Knowledge that undermines order is a threat to the dead.”

Monk Zhen looked at him calmly.

“You’re alive,” Zhen said.

The lieutenant’s jaw tightened.

“I serve the dead,” he snapped.

Zhen nodded.

“Then stop building a court that eats them,” he replied.

The room went silent.

A woman held up an audit sheet.

“We counted,” she said, voice low.

The lieutenant stared.

Counted.

That was the forbidden act.

He raised his blade.

Not to kill.

To intimidate.

Then a Hellborne hammer rang somewhere outside.

Once.

Twice.

A signal.

The lieutenant felt the street shift.

He was not surrounded by fighters.

He was surrounded by a community that now knew how to measure him.

He realized—too late—that raids depended on fear.

Fear depended on mystery.

And mystery was dissolving into arithmetic.

He lowered his blade.

Retreat was a kind of defeat.

But it kept him alive.

Zhen watched him leave and said, softly, to the room:

“Remember the lesson.

They can take paper.

They cannot take a method once you’ve learned it.”

## Notes
- Infinite Arhat’s contribution: turns “count them back” into a scalable practice.
- Hellborne win condition: out-govern the governors, not out-slaughter them.
- Soul Society loss: monopoly on classification fractures when the street learns audits.
