## Scene 1

- **POV**: Master Jian (Cloud-Splitting)
- **Location**: The white court’s public square
- **Goal**: Finish the collapse: defeat nobles and Soul Society by denying them a stage

A court was a building.

A court was also a habit.

Master Jian stood at the edge of the square where the basin still sat—white marble, stubborn as myth.

The nobles had tried to keep it clean.

Warm snow had failed.

Ash had succeeded.

The square was crowded.

Not with obedient lines.

With arguments.

Questions.

People holding counter-seals like they were learning a new kind of citizenship.

A Soul Society captain stood on the steps beside Lady Gao Yue.

Two authorities sharing one stage.

That was never stable.

The captain spoke first.

“In the name of stability,” he announced, “the sweeps will continue.

Unauthorized stamps are treason.

Unauthorized clinics are sedition.

Unauthorized accounting is contagion.”

The crowd hissed.

Not because they loved the Hellborne.

Because they recognized what it meant to be spoken to like livestock.

Lady Gao Yue lifted her hand.

“We offered you bread,” she said.

A man in the crowd shouted back.

“Who decided?”

The question spread like fire.

“WHO DECIDES?”

The Soul Society captain’s face tightened.

He raised his blade slightly.

And revealed the truth beneath the rhetoric.

He was not here to persuade.

He was here to enforce.

Master Jian stepped forward.

He did not draw his sword.

He raised an empty hand.

“I will answer,” he said.

The crowd quieted.

Not because he was holy.

Because he was not wearing a uniform.

He looked at the basin.

Then at the captain.

Then at Gao Yue.

“You want a center,” Master Jian said.

Gao Yue’s smile returned.

“Yes,” she said. “A center prevents chaos.”

Master Jian nodded.

“Then watch,” he said.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: A Hellborne First Smith (unseen presence)
- **Location**: Under the square, at the seam of stone and chain
- **Goal**: Remove the stage’s support; make the court literally fall

The First Smith did not speak.

He listened.

He listened to crowds the way a smith listened to metal cooling.

Too fast and it cracked.

Too slow and it softened.

The square was at the right heat.

He touched the underside supports.

Not with magic.

With leverage.

Bitter River had opened gates.

Seven Sword had shattered procedure.

Shadow Walker had stolen rites.

Soul Blade had cut names loose.

Thunderfury had broken coordination.

Solar-Lunar had split legitimacy.

Mother Trinity had made survival unowned.

Infinite Arhat had taught counting.

Carousing Acalantha had turned shame into laughter.

Now Cloud-Splitting would do the simplest thing.

Make the court fall.

A hidden brace loosened.

Then another.

The basin’s marble lip cracked.

A thin fracture ran outward like a sentence that could not be taken back.

Above, the crowd felt it.

A tremor.

A reminder that stone was not destiny.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Master Jian
- **Location**: The square, as the court collapses
- **Goal**: Force the decisive choice: protect people, not institutions

The stone under the steps shuddered.

Lady Gao Yue’s eyes widened.

The Soul Society captain barked orders.

Guards surged.

The crowd scattered.

Not in panic.

In practiced evacuation lanes—Thunderfury’s corridors, Hellborne lantern signals, Bitter River flows.

The court tried to hold.

It could not.

The steps cracked.

A pillar split.

White stone fell in slow motion, as if even gravity wanted the nobles to have time to reconsider.

They did not.

They grabbed at symbols.

The captain raised his blade to strike the crowd.

Master Jian stepped into his path.

“You can kill,” Master Jian said.

The captain’s eyes were hard.

“Yes,” he replied.

Master Jian nodded.

“Then admit what you are,” he said.

The captain swung.

Master Jian did not meet the blade.

He redirected it.

Not into flesh.

Into the basin.

The blade struck marble.

The basin shattered.

Water spilled across the square.

Not clean.

Not sacred.

Just water.

The crowd saw it.

Saw the symbol break.

Saw the court’s language fail.

Lady Gao Yue stared at the rubble.

Her voice was thin.

“This is anarchy,” she whispered.

A woman in the crowd held up a counter-seal.

“No,” the woman said.

“It’s a different kind of order.”

The Soul Society captain stepped back, suddenly aware of witnesses.

Too many.

Too awake.

He signaled retreat.

He would return later with larger units.

But later was a luxury.

Because the city had learned, in one visible moment, that courts could fall.

Master Jian looked at the rubble and spoke to the crowd.

“Keep your counts,” he said.

“Keep your clinics.

Keep your jokes.

Keep your routes.

If they want to rule, make them explain themselves every day.”

The crowd answered, not with a chant.

With work.

They lifted stones.

They carried the wounded.

They distributed water.

A court had ended.

Not because a king crowned a new one.

Because the Hellborne and the Ten Sects made the old one impossible to maintain.

## Notes
- Resolution: Nobles lose the stage (symbols + infrastructure); Soul Society retreats to avoid witnessed oppression.
- Each sect’s contribution culminates in a public, undeniable collapse of “holy order.”
- Setup for next arc: the question becomes what replaces the fallen court—without recreating it.
