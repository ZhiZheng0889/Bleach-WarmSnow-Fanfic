	- Hua Rin (Soul Blade Shura)
	- Marble Compact ritualist (unnamed)
	- Soul Society captain (unnamed)
	- Noble liaison (unnamed)
	- Hellborne smith (unnamed)
- **Returning**:

- **Changes (status / power / gear / role)**:
	- Soul Blade Shura reframes power: anti-binding technique becomes a transferable method (not a Warm Snow “gift”)

## Scene 1

- **POV**: Hua Rin (Soul Blade Shura)
- **Location**: Hidden canal shrine where names feel heavy
- **Goal**: Break the Name-Eater’s grip by severing what it hooks onto

Hua Rin did not believe names were sacred.

She believed they were useful.

A sword had a name.

A city had a name.

A person had a name.

Useful meant vulnerable.

The Name-Eater scroll made names heavy.

Not metaphorically.

Functionally.

It turned identity into a handle the court could pull.

Hua Rin sat before a cracked shrine and drew her blade.

The blade was plain.

No crest.

No scripture.

But its edge had been quenched in something that remembered the seam.

Warm snow hissed when it touched.

A Hellborne smith stood behind her, quiet.

He wasn’t here as a bodyguard.

He was here as a witness, and as a craftsman.

The Hellborne had begun turning techniques into blueprints—short manuals you could teach, copy, and hand down from one Floor to the next.

Not scripture.

Not lineage.

Method.

“You’re sure?” he asked.

Hua Rin’s eyes stayed on the blade.

“No,” she replied.

Certainty was a luxury.

She lifted the sword and spoke a sentence like a vow.

“I will not be legible,” she said.

Then she cut.

Not flesh.

Air.

The cut made a sound like paper tearing.

The smith felt the pressure change and quietly marked it on a strip of paper—angle, breath, timing.

Not to claim it.

To reproduce it.

A pressure in the room released.

Her chest loosened.

For the first time in weeks, her name did not bruise.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Marble Compact ritualist
- **Location**: Inner archive
- **Goal**: Use the Name-Eater to slow sect logistics; discover the counter-technique

The ritualist opened the lacquer box with shaking hands.

He had told himself it was for bandits.

Only.

He touched brush to ink.

He wrote a name.

Hua Rin.

The character sank into pale scroll surface.

He waited for the familiar ring in his ears.

Nothing.

He frowned.

He pressed harder.

Still nothing.

The scroll’s pale surface rippled.

Then the character floated back up.

As if rejected.

The ritualist’s mouth went dry.

“That’s impossible,” he whispered.

A guard leaned in.

“My lord?”

The ritualist swallowed.

“Their names are slipping,” he said.

The guard blinked.

“People’s names can’t slip.”

The ritualist stared at the scroll.

Then he whispered the truth he did not want to admit:

“They learned how to cut the handle.”

And that meant the enemy was no longer a handful of anomalies.

It was a system.

Teach one person to sever a binding and the court could call it a fluke.

Teach a Floor, publish the steps, and it became a contagion of competence.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Soul Society captain
- **Location**: Emergency council with noble liaisons
- **Goal**: Preserve name-binding as governance; authorize harsher extraction

The captain listened to the ritualist’s report and felt anger rise.

Anger was easier than fear.

“If they can evade the Name-Eater,” the captain said, “they can evade summons.

They can evade court.

They can evade classification.”

A noble liaison’s voice was thin.

“Can you stop it?”

The captain’s eyes sharpened.

“Yes,” he said.

“How?”

The captain did not like the answer.

So he made it sound like duty.

“We stop relying on names,” he said.

The room went quiet.

The ritualist’s hands trembled.

“That means—”

“It means rounding,” the captain said.

“Neighborhoods.

Families.

Workshops.

We take whole blocks and sort them later.”

The noble liaison paled.

“That’s war.”

The captain nodded.

“Yes,” he said.

“And the Hellborne are winning because they made governance expensive.

So we make their victory too costly to attempt.”

He did not call it evil.

He called it stabilization.

That was how the proto–reaper cadres were being born: not as heroes in clean uniforms, but as an institution’s answer to embarrassment.

If you couldn’t bind a person, you bound a district.

He stood.

“Prepare the sweep.”

Outside, warm snow fell.

Inside, an institution decided the difference between law and massacre was only a stamp.

## Notes
- Soul Blade Shura’s “defeat” is technical: breaks the Name-Eater by severing name-legibility.
- Consequence: Soul Society escalates from targeted binding to area sweeps, exposing authoritarian nature.
- Hellborne advantage: turns anti-binding into a teachable blueprint across Floors, forcing the enemy to choose between losing control and revealing cruelty.
