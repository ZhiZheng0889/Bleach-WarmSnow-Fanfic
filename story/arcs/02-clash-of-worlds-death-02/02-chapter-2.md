## Scene 1

- **POV**: Madam Lian (Carousing Acalantha host)
- **Location**: A teahouse that survives by changing names
- **Goal**: Turn the nobles’ propaganda into a drunk confession

The Marble Compact’s new rite did not begin with a blade.

It began with a story.

A priest would stand in a square and teach the crowd to feel shame for asking questions.

Shame was cheaper than jail.

Madam Lian had built her teahouse on a different economy.

If the realm insisted on being governed by feelings, then she would sell the ones the court couldn’t control.

Tonight her tables were full.

Not because the city was peaceful.

Because fear made people thirsty.

A Hellborne courier sat in the corner, hood low.

Across from him sat a young court clerk—one of the ones who still flinched when he stamped a seal.

The clerk’s hands trembled around his cup.

“I shouldn’t be here,” he whispered.

Madam Lian poured him more anyway.

“Then you’re exactly where you need to be,” she said.

The tea was not drugged.

It didn’t need to be.

The real intoxicant was being spoken to like a person.

On the stage, an Acalantha performer began a song.

Not a rebel anthem.

A court hymn.

Perfectly copied.

Perfectly respectful.

The audience laughed, confused.

Then the performer shifted a single line.

*If you are counted, you are protected.*

Became:

*If you are counted, you are collected.*

The laughter sharpened.

It carried teeth.

Madam Lian watched the clerk’s face.

He tried to smile.

It came out like pain.

A priest entered the teahouse with two guards.

Not a raid.

A demonstration.

The priest lifted a scroll.

“By Compact authority,” he announced, “this establishment is accused of hosting unregistered gatherings.

Questions are sinful. Rumors are banditry.

Submit your registry.”

Madam Lian bowed.

Low enough to look compliant.

High enough to keep her eyes on him.

“Of course,” she said.

Then she clapped once.

Her servers began to pour.

Not tea.

Ink.

Black and thick, into cups that had been prepared in advance.

The audience murmured.

Madam Lian smiled.

“Since questions are sinful,” she said softly, “let us confess.

Let us confess what we have been taught to call stability.

Let us confess who profits when we are ashamed.”

The priest’s face reddened.

“This is sedition.”

“It’s karaoke,” Madam Lian replied.

The room laughed.

The guards hesitated.

Because you could arrest a banner.

You could arrest a sword.

But how do you arrest a joke that already lives in everyone’s mouth?

## Scene 2

- **POV**: A Hellborne propagandist (the “Chalksmith”)
- **Location**: Alley walls and ration lines
- **Goal**: Spread a counter-rite that makes shame unusable

The Chalksmith never met crowds.

He met surfaces.

A wall was a public memory that hadn’t been assigned yet.

Tonight, he wrote where the ration line would have to see it.

Not slogans.

Instructions.

- If a priest says questions are sinful, ask him who wrote the sin.
- If a guard says names bind, ask him whose name never appears.
- If a seal promises food, ask why food needs permission.

He signed it with a crude Acalantha bloom.

A symbol for drunkenness.

A symbol for honesty.

A clerk in line read it and laughed.

Then looked around, frightened by his own laughter.

The Chalksmith watched from the shadow.

He didn’t need bravery.

He needed repetition.

Short things spread.

## Scene 3

- **POV**: A Soul Society censor
- **Location**: Temporary tribunal office
- **Goal**: Classify the “joke-plague” as a spiritual contagion; authorize suppression

The censor listened to the reports with disgust.

“Songs,” the noble liaison said. “They’re rewriting hymns.

They’re mocking the registry.

They’re turning your Majesty’s speech into street comedy.”

The censor’s brush hovered.

Comedy was harder to ban than steel.

Steel only cut bodies.

Comedy cut meaning.

“This is not rebellion,” the censor said.

The liaison blinked.

“It’s not?”

“It’s a rival liturgy,” the censor replied.

He stamped a seal onto a new document:

**EDICT OF SILENCE**

The title was elegant.

The intent was simple.

“Confiscate broadsides.

Arrest performers.

Mark hosts.

Sever rumor lines.

And if the Hellborne use laughter as a shield,” the censor said, “teach the city that laughter costs blood.”

The noble liaison exhaled, relieved.

A method.

A plan.

The censor looked out at the window where warm snow fell and did not melt.

He did not see people.

He saw a system trying to be born.

And he decided it would be strangled before it learned to speak.

## Notes
- Carousing Acalantha’s role: weaponizes social space and humor to break propaganda.
- Hellborne advantage: memetic counter-rites spread faster than enforcement.
- Soul Society reaction: reclassifies “culture” as threat and escalates suppression.
