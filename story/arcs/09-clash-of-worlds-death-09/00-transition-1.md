## Scene 1

- **POV**: A propagandist (TBD)
- **Location**: A print shop
- **Goal**: Define Ren before Ren can define himself

Ink was cheaper than swords.

It was also faster.

The propagandist printed leaflets showing a door drawn like a halo.

Under it:

“THE BRIDGE BELONGS TO ORDER.”

He printed another set with a different slogan.

“THE BRIDGE BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE.”

He smiled.

Contradictions were not a problem.

Contradictions were a tactic.

If everyone argued about ownership, no one would ask the real question.

What does the door want?

The print shop was hot.

Not from fire.

From pressure.

Ink pots steamed.

The press groaned.

Apprentices moved with speed that looked like devotion and was really fear.

The propagandist stood over the plates like a priest over scripture.

He watched the door-halo image appear again and again.

Each time it did, it became less a drawing and more a claim.

He printed one hundred copies.

Then two.

Then five.

Truth did not matter.

Repetition did.

He slid a stack to a runner.

“Spread these near the depot,” he said.

The runner frowned.

“Which message?” she asked.

The propagandist smiled.

“Both,” he said.

The runner hesitated.

“That’s contradictory,” she said.

The propagandist’s smile widened.

“Exactly,” he replied. “If they fight over ownership, they won’t ask what the door costs.”

The runner swallowed.

“And what does it cost?” she asked.

The propagandist’s eyes flicked toward the back room, where a small box sat under cloth.

He did not answer.

Some questions, if spoken, turned into obligations.

## Scene 2

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: A safehouse doorway
- **Goal**: Survive the tightening net without becoming a symbol

Ren read a leaflet and felt himself shrink into a drawing.

He was tired of being an idea.

Ideas could be burned.

Ideas could be possessed.

People could be fed.

People could be sheltered.

Ren folded the leaflet and set it aside.

He turned to the others in the room.

“We move at dawn,” he said.

Someone asked, “Where?”

Ren stared at the wall.

He did not want to say the answer.

Because it sounded like surrender.

“Between,” he said.

The safehouse smelled like boiled roots and damp cloth.

People had been living too close together for too long.

Someone’s baby cried in a back room.

Someone tried to hush it.

The sound made Ren’s jaw tighten.

Babies were honest.

They didn’t care about treaties.

They didn’t care about slogans.

They cared about whether the room was warm.

Ren looked at the leaflet again.

THE BRIDGE BELONGS TO ORDER.

THE BRIDGE BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE.

He could feel both hands reaching.

Different gloves.

Same grip.

Someone in the room spoke.

“If they’re printing this, they know,” a man said.

“Know what?” someone else asked.

The man shrugged.

“Know there’s a door,” he said. “Know there’s you.”

Ren’s throat tightened.

He didn’t like the sentence.

There’s you.

As if he were a location.

As if he were a resource.

He forced his voice steady.

“We move at dawn,” he repeated.

The baby cried again.

Someone muttered a curse.

The room was tired.

Tired people made bad choices.

Ren could not afford a bad choice.

“Where?” someone asked again.

Ren stared at the wall.

He did not want to say the answer.

Because it sounded like surrender.

Because it sounded like hiding.

Because it sounded like feeding the corridor.

“Between,” he said.

Silence.

Not disbelief.

Fear.

Ren looked at their faces.

He realized something: the corridor was no longer just his burden.

It was becoming a community decision.

And community decisions could be manipulated.

## Notes

## Notes

- Continuity: Positions Stage 09 as narrative siege + forced relocation.
- Foreshadowing: Choosing “between” as refuge risks turning refuge into prison.
