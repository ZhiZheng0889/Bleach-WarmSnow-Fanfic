## Scene 1

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: The corridor
- **Goal**: Hide people in “between” without letting the corridor claim them

Ren opened the door.

Not for rescue.

For concealment.

The corridor accepted them too quickly.

That was the first warning.

Inside, the gray did not shiver like it used to.

It felt steadier.

As if it had been preparing a room.

Someone behind Ren whispered, “It’s safe.”

Ren did not answer.

Safe was not a feeling.

Safe was an outcome.

He led them through in groups.

Not because he wanted to.

Because too many bodies at once made the seam flare, and flares drew attention.

Ren had learned that the corridor listened.

Now he suspected it also remembered.

Inside, the gray was steadier.

Not comforting.

Organized.

As if the corridor had been rearranging itself while Ren argued with councils and refused treaties.

The air smelled like nothing.

That nothingness made people talk.

Talking made them human.

Humanity, Ren feared, was what the corridor was learning to use.

Someone whispered, “It’s safe.”

Ren did not answer.

He counted heads.

He counted breaths.

He watched for panic.

Panic would trigger the seam.

The corridor loved urgency.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: Deeper in the corridor
- **Goal**: Realize hiding is also feeding; decide how to escape the corridor’s logic

The corridor had corners now.

That was new.

Corners meant design.

Design meant intention.

Ren felt the corridor’s hunger like pressure on the back of his eyes.

He understood the trap.

If he used the corridor as a home, the corridor would become a landlord.

Landlords always collected.

Ren turned back toward the door.

He began counting everyone.

Not for bureaucracy.

For rescue.

Because the corridor was learning how to keep what it was given.

Ren walked deeper to find a space that felt less eager.

He found a stretch where the gray walls bowed outward, as if making room.

“Stay here,” he told them.

Someone asked, “For how long?”

Ren’s throat tightened.

He could not answer.

He did not know whether time behaved here.

He did not know whether sleep was safe.

He did not know whether the corridor could decide to close.

“Until dawn,” he lied.

It was a small lie.

It felt like a big one.

The corridor’s pressure settled behind his eyes.

He understood the trap.

If he used the corridor as a home, the corridor would become a landlord.

Landlords always collected.

Rent could be paid in money.

Or in silence.

Or in bodies.

Ren turned back toward the door.

He began counting everyone.

Not for bureaucracy.

For rescue.

Then he saw something he had never seen in the corridor before.

A mark.

Not carved.

Not painted.

A smudge in the gray that looked like a handprint.

Ren stared.

His stomach dropped.

He looked at his own hands.

The print was not his.

He backed away.

The corridor had learned to leave signs.

Or someone else had.

Either possibility made his skin prickle.

## Notes

## Notes

- Continuity: Escalates “between” from passage to environment.
- Foreshadowing: Stage 10 will force a final decision about the corridor’s role in the three worlds.
