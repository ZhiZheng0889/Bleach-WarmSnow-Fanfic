# Death Stage 06 — Clash Between Worlds (Arc Guide)

This stage bridges from the prior fallout into the next escalation.

## Core Throughline

- Navigation becomes the battleground: maps, routes, and checkpoints decide who gets to move.
- Decentralization becomes design work: practices that survive swords and stamps.
- The corridor stops being a wound and starts acting like an **agent**.

## Key Terms (quick reference)

- **Paper walls**: curfews, permits, and checkpoint notices that make the world “legible.”
- **Third path (Master Jian)**: anti-center governance practices (rotation, refusal, transparency) that resist both courts and mobs.
- **Corridor agency**: signs the corridor can anticipate, train, and choose (rhythm, testing, ease-as-trap).
