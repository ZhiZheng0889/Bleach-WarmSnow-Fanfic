## Scene 1

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: A cartographer’s shop
- **Goal**: Find a route that avoids surveillance and superstition

The cartographer’s maps were beautiful.

And wrong.

Not in the way that rivers changed.

Wrong in the way that politics changed borders.

Ren traced a road with his finger.

The cartographer cleared his throat.

“That road doesn’t exist anymore,” he said.

Ren looked up.

“It’s on the map,” Ren said.

The cartographer shrugged.

“So is mercy,” he replied.

Ren paid for the map anyway.

He had learned that lies could still contain useful shapes.

Ren rolled the map slowly, careful not to crease it.

Paper was expensive.

Paper also carried authority now.

In the city, a stamped paper could open doors that compassion could not.

Ren paid the cartographer and stepped back into the street.

Outside, a patrol passed.

Not soldiers exactly.

Men and women with armbands and tired eyes, carrying clubs instead of blades.

The new order, still improvising.

Ren pressed himself into the shadow of an awning.

He watched the patrol’s leader gesture at a posted notice.

Ren couldn’t read the full text from here, but he could recognize the shape.

Curfews.

Checkpoints.

Permits.

Paper walls.

Ren’s chest tightened.

He looked down at the map.

The ink lines promised clean routes.

They promised a world where borders were stable enough to be drawn.

Ren understood why people loved maps.

Maps were reassurance.

Maps said: the world can be known.

Ren folded the map and kept walking.

He would use it the way he used rumors.

Not as truth.

As direction.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Master Jian (Cloud-Splitting)
- **Location**: A ridge overlooking the city
- **Goal**: Choose what to protect when every choice creates enemies

Master Jian watched patrols move like ink strokes across the streets.

He could disrupt them.

He could also provoke a crackdown.

He remembered the square.

He remembered how quickly “stability” became permission for violence.

He exhaled.

“We need a third path,” he said.

Someone behind him asked, “A third path to what?”

Master Jian answered without looking back.

“A third path to the future,” he said. “One that does not require a center.”

## Scene 3

- **POV**: Master Jian (Cloud-Splitting)
- **Location**: A ridge overlooking the city
- **Goal**: Choose what to protect when every choice creates enemies

The ridge wind cut cold across Master Jian’s cheeks.

Below, patrols moved like ink strokes across streets.

Not the old court’s guards.

New ones.

Volunteers.

Militia.

Some well-intentioned.

Some eager.

He could disrupt them.

He could also provoke a crackdown.

He remembered the square.

He remembered how quickly “stability” became permission for violence.

He exhaled.

“We need a third path,” he said.

Someone behind him asked, “A third path to what?”

Master Jian answered without looking back.

“A third path to the future,” he said. “One that does not require a center.”

The companion shifted.

“And the door?” the companion asked.

Master Jian’s eyes narrowed.

“The door is the problem we cannot solve with swords,” he said. “So we must solve it with practices that survive swords.”

## Notes

- Continuity: Sets Stage 06 as navigation (literal + political) and the search for decentralization.
- Foreshadowing: Maps, routes, and corridors will start to overlap.
