## Scene 1

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: The threshold, looking out
- **Goal**: See the big picture: the corridor is now part of the world’s infrastructure

Ren stood at the seam and looked out.

He did not see one world.

He saw three.

Not separate.

Entangled.

Threads crossing where they were not meant to cross.

The corridor between them was no longer a mistake.

It was a scar.

Scars changed movement.

Scars changed posture.

Scars changed the stories people told about what was possible.

Ren realized something that made him cold.

Even if he died, the scar would remain.

Others would learn to pick at it.

He did not have language for what he saw.

Not fully.

The three worlds did not overlap like ink.

They overlapped like wounds.

Edges rubbed.

Pressure built.

Sometimes the skin tore.

Ren watched a thread of air shimmer as if a street in one world briefly remembered a street in another.

He watched a sound—distant bells, distant shouting—arrive out of order.

He had once thought the corridor was a hallway.

Now he understood it was connective tissue.

Connective tissue could be strengthened.

Or inflamed.

Or cut.

Ren realized something that made him cold.

Even if he died, the scar would remain.

Others would learn to pick at it.

And some would call it healing.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Master Jian (Cloud-Splitting)
- **Location**: Beside Ren at the threshold
- **Goal**: Offer a final framework: not ownership, but stewardship

Master Jian spoke quietly.

“You can’t make the scar disappear,” he said.

Ren didn’t look at him.

“Then what do I do?” Ren asked.

Master Jian took a long breath.

“You decide what it becomes,” he said. “A wound people exploit. Or a joint people strengthen.”

Ren finally turned.

“And if the corridor wants something else?” Ren asked.

Master Jian’s eyes were tired.

“Then we will have to negotiate with the world itself,” he said.

Ren laughed once.

It came out dry.

“Negotiate,” he repeated.

Master Jian nodded.

“You have been negotiating since the first time you asked the corridor for passage,” he said. “You simply didn’t call it that.”

Ren stared at the seam.

It did not look like a thing that could be persuaded.

It looked like a rule.

Rules did not listen.

Rules simply applied.

And yet—

Ren had seen it tighten.

Seen it widen.

Seen it respond.

Master Jian followed Ren’s gaze.

“If a rule can change,” Master Jian said, “then it is not only a rule. It is a participant.”

Ren’s throat tightened.

“Participants have desires,” he said.

“Yes,” Master Jian replied.

They stood together in the thinness.

For once, neither of them tried to solve the world with a sentence.

## Notes

## Notes

- Continuity: Sets Stage 10 as culmination: the seam is permanent and contested.
- Foreshadowing: The final conflict is not only factions vs Ren, but humans vs the corridor’s agency.
