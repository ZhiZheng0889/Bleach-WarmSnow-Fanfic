## Scene 1

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: A quiet room, night
- **Goal**: Confront the seam’s appetite; realize it may prefer certain kinds of crossings

Ren dreamed of doors.

In the dream, each door had a mouth.

In the dream, each mouth asked for the same thing.

“More.”

Ren woke with his hand outstretched.

The air in front of him felt thin.

Not open.

Inviting.

Ren pulled his hand back.

He whispered, “You want movement.”

The seam did not deny it.

He understood then that the corridor’s “cost” was not only payment.

It was feeding.

In the dream, the doors were arranged like a market.

Rows.

Stalls.

Mouths opening and closing with wet patience.

Ren walked between them.

Each door watched him.

Not with eyes.

With expectation.

“More,” they said.

And the word was not a request.

It was a rule.

Ren woke with his hand outstretched.

The air in front of him felt thin.

Not open.

Inviting.

Ren pulled his hand back.

His heart hammered.

He stared into the dark.

He whispered, “You want movement.”

The seam did not deny it.

Ren swallowed.

He understood then that the corridor’s cost was not only payment.

It was feeding.

Feeding meant appetite.

Appetite meant escalation.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: The same room
- **Goal**: Decide to starve the corridor, even if it means less rescue

Ren sat up and stared at the wall until morning.

He wrote rules again.

Not for morality.

For survival.

“No unnecessary openings,” he wrote.

“No openings for convenience.”

“No openings to avoid grief.”

He paused.

Then wrote the worst one.

“Sometimes, no opening at all.”

Ren’s hand shook.

He hated the sentence.

He wrote it anyway.

The room slowly filled with gray light.

Outside, someone coughed.

Someone else argued in a low voice.

Life continued.

Ren’s list sat on his lap like a weapon.

He realized with a bitterness that rules were always written after mistakes.

Rules were scars turned into language.

He read what he’d written.

No unnecessary openings.

No openings for convenience.

No openings to avoid grief.

Sometimes, no opening at all.

He hated the last line.

Because it meant refusing someone.

Refusing someone meant owning their outcome.

Ren had tried to escape that kind of responsibility.

The world kept handing it back.

He folded the paper.

He stood.

He did not feel resolved.

He felt braced.

Like someone stepping into a storm with a rope tied to his waist.

## Notes

## Notes

- Continuity: Makes explicit that the corridor may “feed” on crossings.
- Foreshadowing: Starving the corridor will provoke retaliation or escalation.
