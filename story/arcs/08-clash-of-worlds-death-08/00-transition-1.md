# Chapter — A Door for the Dead (Death Stage 08)

## Scene 1

- **POV**: Ren
- **Location**: A battlefield aftermath
- **Goal**: Prevent the seam from being used as a disposal chute

Bodies made politics honest.

Ren stood among them and felt the world’s edges pull.

Someone nearby whispered, “We could… move them.”

Not bury.

Not mourn.

Move.

Ren understood the proposal immediately.

Open a door.

Throw grief through.

Let “between” become a trash pit.

Ren shook his head.

“If we do that,” he said, “the corridor will learn what we think the dead are worth.”

The silence that followed was ugly.

It contained anger.

It also contained shame.

The field had been a road once.

Or a market.

Or a place where people pretended there would always be tomorrow.

Now it was a scatter of broken carts, torn cloth, and bodies laid out in lines that tried to be respectful.

Respect looked different when you were out of time.

Ren stood among the dead and felt the world’s edges pull.

The seam inside him reacted the way it always did near mass loss.

Not sympathy.

Opportunity.

Someone behind him whispered, “We could… move them.”

Ren turned.

The speaker was a man with soot on his face and a bandage over one ear.

His eyes were dry.

Not because he didn’t care.

Because he’d cried everything out already.

“Move,” Ren repeated.

The man nodded.

“We can’t bury this many,” he said. “Not before sickness. Not before the patrols come. Not before someone claims this field as proof we’re failing.”

Ren understood the proposal immediately.

Open a door.

Throw grief through.

Let “between” become a trash pit.

Efficiency disguised as mercy.

Ren shook his head.

“If we do that,” he said, “the corridor will learn what we think the dead are worth.”

The man’s jaw flexed.

“They’re dead,” he snapped. “Worth isn’t the question.”

Ren looked at the bodies.

He saw hands that had carried sacks.

He saw a woman with a broken lantern still in her grip.

He saw a child’s shoe.

Worth was always the question.

Because worth was what decided what you did when no one was watching.

“The corridor is watching,” Ren said quietly.

The silence that followed was ugly.

It contained anger.

It contained shame.

It contained the raw fact that ethics cost time.

Time cost lives.

## Scene 2

- **POV**: Master Jian (Cloud-Splitting)
- **Location**: The edge of the same field
- **Goal**: Admit that ethics has become tactical

Master Jian watched Ren refuse.

He admired it.

He also feared it.

Refusals cost time.

Time cost lives.

Master Jian approached carefully.

“You’re right,” he said.

Ren’s eyes flicked to him.

“And if being right gets more people killed?” Ren asked.

Master Jian did not answer quickly.

Because the question was not a trap.

It was the new world.

Master Jian stepped closer, boots crunching on gravel.

He looked past Ren at the bodies.

He did not flinch.

He had seen enough death to know flinching was a luxury.

“You’re right,” he said.

Ren’s eyes flicked to him.

“And if being right gets more people killed?” Ren asked.

Master Jian did not answer quickly.

Because the question was not a trap.

It was the new world.

Finally, Master Jian said, “Then we will have to pay the cost openly.”

Ren’s throat tightened.

“Openly how?”

Master Jian gestured to the living.

“With labor,” he said. “With mourning. With the kind of work people can see, so no one can pretend the dead were convenient.”

Ren looked at the bandaged man.

The man looked away.

Not in shame.

In defeat.

Because defeat meant more digging.

Ren exhaled.

He raised his voice.

“Shovels,” Ren called. “Cloth. Water. We do this the slow way.”

Some people groaned.

Some people nodded.

Master Jian watched the nods.

Those nods were the future.
