# Prologue — When the Worlds Were Uncut

## Scene 1

- **POV**: The First Smith (Hellborne founder)
- **Location**: The seam between raw realms (before the walls, before the courts)
- **Goal**: Claim permission—or justification—to forge a society from Hell

Warm snow fell in silence.

Not the soft drift of winter, not the ash of a burned city—this was reishi cooling from a sky that had not yet chosen what it wanted to be. It landed on the First Smith’s bare forearms and did not melt. It sank, slowly, like breath into lungs, and the air tasted of iron and clean water.

Below his feet, the ground was neither stone nor soil. It was a stretched skin of reality: black in one direction, white in another, and in between a bruised band where everything argued with everything else.

He set his anvil down where the argument was loudest.

In that age, setting something down was more than a gesture.

Weight became claim.
Claim became boundary.
Boundary—given time and belief—became a world.

The anvil had no name, because names implied ownership, and ownership implied law. In that era there was only weight and intent. He carried both.

From the black side came heat without flame: furnaces imagined by hungry souls. From the white side came order without kindness: lines drawn so straight they cut.

He turned his face toward the white.

A figure waited there—motionless, patient enough to be terrifying. The First Smith felt the pressure first, not as force, but as a demand: *Be defined.*

“Soul King,” the First Smith said.

The title did not echo. The realm swallowed it, as if the sound had always belonged to that figure.

The Soul King’s eyes were open, and yet the First Smith had the unnerving sense that he was being watched by something older than sight.

“You came from the lower heat,” the Soul King said. His voice was not loud. It did not need to be.

“I came from the only place that admits what it is,” the First Smith replied. He rested his palm on the anvil. The metal answered with a dull, eager thrum. “Down there, hunger is honest. Suffering is measurable. If a soul breaks, it breaks where you can see the cracks.”

He did not add *why* he trusted hunger.

He had walked through a world that looked, from far away, like paradise—clans and courts and banners, all silk and ceremony. Then the Warm Snow began: heat where cold should be, omens that never stopped, a curse that turned daily life into a slow famine.

The lords hoarded grain and remedies and called it “stewardship.” They rationed mercy like coin. They preached that hierarchy was the only way to keep panic from tearing the streets apart.

And when the streets tore anyway, it was not the noble houses that kept people alive.

It was the workshops.
The shared kitchens.
The hand that passed a bowl without asking for a surname.
Survivors who learned—quickly, brutally—that the only thing sturdier than a wall was a promise made between equals.

Warm snow kept falling. It dusted the Soul King’s robe and did not cling. It touched the First Smith’s shoulders and stayed, as if it recognized a forge.

“You want to build,” the Soul King said.

“I want to *temper*,” the First Smith corrected. “A world that cannot be heated cannot be strengthened. A soul that is never tested becomes brittle.”

“I have seen what happens when a world pretends it can stay untested,” he continued. “It doesn’t become peaceful. It becomes fragile.

And the first time something real strikes it, the whole structure shatters—and the ones at the bottom pay the blood-price.”

The Soul King’s gaze moved—fractionally—to the anvil.

The First Smith felt it like a hand on his wrist: not restraint, but appraisal.

“You would make a doctrine from pain.”

“I would make a ladder from it.” The First Smith’s fingers tightened until the anvil sang. “If there will be law, then let it be earned. If there will be rank, let it be forged. Let the weak become strong by craft and will—not by accident of birth, not by which side of a gate they were thrown onto.”

He lifted his chin, as if tasting the word the other wore like a crown.

“Not a kingdom,” he added. “A commune. No noble houses. No inherited stations. The forge belongs to the hands that work it, and what it makes returns to the many—not hoarded behind gates and titles.”

The First Smith’s voice stayed even, but his intent sharpened.

“Not ‘charity’ from above,” he said. “Not mercy as a privilege. A society where the means to survive—the furnace, the grain, the blade, the seal—are held in common, because disaster does not ask permission before it arrives.”

The Soul King looked past him, into the black.

The First Smith followed the line of that gaze and saw what the Soul King saw: an infinity of souls piling against each other, compressed by their own fear, generating heat the way rot generates gas. In the distance, shapes moved—cities of chain, furnaces built from prayer and profanity.

“That place will devour its own,” the Soul King said.

“Yes,” the First Smith answered without flinching. “So I will teach it to devour with purpose.”

The Soul King’s expression did not change. Somehow, that was the sharpest condemnation.

“There is another way,” the Soul King said. “To separate, to balance. To keep each thing in its place so the whole does not collapse.”

As he spoke, the white side answered him.

Lines gathered in the air like threads pulled taut. A center implied itself—an axis, a court, a sacred point from which everything else could be measured and commanded.

The First Smith laughed once—dry, more sound of disbelief than mirth.

“Balance is a word people use when they want stillness,” he said. “Stillness is death that flatters itself. You would freeze the world because you fear what it becomes when it moves.”

“I would prevent endless war,” the Soul King replied.

The First Smith stepped forward, and the seam beneath his boots rippled. The warm snow rose from the ground as if startled.

“You would prevent war by building cages,” he said. “Walls. Courts. Titles that declare some souls sacred and others disposable. You would call it order.”

He gestured toward the white, toward the straightness that cut.

“A throne at the center,” he went on, “and beneath it—lords, then vassals, then the countless who are told their suffering is the price of stability.”

The seam trembled under the weight of the idea.

The Soul King’s eyes sharpened.

“And you,” he said, “would call it freedom to turn Hell into a machine. A society that measures worth by what survives the fire.”

The First Smith’s hand slid across the anvil, and the black side answered too.

Not with lines.

With a tear.

It was not violence for its own sake. It was extraction: a portion of the Greater Hell pulled loose from the endless pressure, folded and braced like hot metal taken from a furnace and hammered into shape.

For a heartbeat, the First Smith glimpsed what it could become—furnace-cities with shared bellows, chain-bridges hung over voids, workshops organized not by blood but by Path and purpose.

The First Smith did not deny it.

“Fire reveals what lies,” he said. “Your order hides it. You will make a world where souls pretend not to hurt, and you will name that pretense ‘peace.’”

The Soul King’s gaze drifted upward. The warm snow fell between them like a curtain.

“In the end,” the Soul King said, “your ladder reaches the same height as any other. Above it is only collapse.”

“Then let collapse be honest too,” the First Smith said.

He drew a thin strip of metal from his sleeve—dark as the black realm, veined with pale light. Scrap, found where it should not exist. A shard that did not belong to either side.

He held it up.

The realm reacted.

The white side tightened, as if offended. The black side exhaled, as if hungry.

The Soul King’s eyes fixed on the shard.

“Where did you take that?”

The First Smith met his gaze and did not look away.

“I did not take it from you,” he said. “I found what the world shed when it tried to become whole.”

The Soul King’s voice turned colder than the snow.

“There are pieces that must not be forged.”

The First Smith’s smile was small and inexorable.

“There are pieces that *beg* to be,” he said.

For the first time, the Soul King moved.

Not a step. Not a gesture. Just the slightest shift of presence—as if the axis of all things had rotated a fraction.

The First Smith felt the future align itself like a blade along a whetstone.

“You will build your society,” the Soul King said, and it did not sound like permission. “And I will build my order. Between them, there will be an abyss.

“And the abyss,” he added, “will have a name.”

The First Smith lowered the shard, cradling it like a promise.

“Good,” he said. “Names are useful. They let people pretend a boundary is natural. Then they stop watching it.

“And when they stop watching,” he finished softly, “that is when the seam opens.”

Warm snow fell.

Somewhere deep in the black, a furnace answered.

## Notes
- Continuity: This is pre-Seireitei / pre-courts; establishes the philosophical root of Hellborne doctrine vs Soul King’s balance.
- Foreshadowing: The “shard” implies Soul King scrap later scattered into Hell’s strata (ties into `hellborne-bleach.md` Ancient clash).
