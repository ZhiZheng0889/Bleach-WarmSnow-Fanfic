# Bleach × Warm Snow — Fanfic Project

A fanfic writing repository merging *Bleach* and *Warm Snow* into a single cultivation/afterlife setting.

## Structure
- `story/`: chapters and scenes
- `characters/`: character sheets
- `worldbuilding/`: setting notes, systems, terminology
- `outline/`: plot and beat outlines
- `notes/`: scratch notes and ideas
- `templates/`: writing templates
- `data/`: reference tables (CSV)
- `scripts/`: helper scripts (optional)

## Getting started
1. Start a chapter in `story/`.
2. Keep canon divergence notes in `worldbuilding/`.
3. Update `TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md` as you add files.
